# Amsterdam Design System

This is the guide for the user interfaces of all digital products and services provided by the City of Amsterdam.

We offer reusable components, patterns and guides for teams that work on our websites and applications.
This helps everyone work faster and better, with more time to create value.
To our citizens and businesses, all our channels look the same and work similarly;
they are broadly accessible and evoke trust.

We aim to create libraries for, or support otherwise, Figma, CSS, React, React Native, Salesforce, and Mendix.
