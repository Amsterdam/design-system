# Checkbox

Allows users to make a selection or agree to terms.

## Guidelines

- Checkboxes are used for one or multiple choices that do not exclude each other.
- Each checkbox operates independently of other checkboxes in a list at the same hierarchical level.
  Checking an additional checkbox does not affect other selections in that list.
- You can use a checkbox for bulk selection or deselection of an entire list of checkboxes.
  Still, it should be clear that the bulk selection checkbox is at a different hierarchical level than the list being fully selected or deselected.
- Use a group of checkboxes to filter data on a page, in a menu, or within a component.
- A checkbox can answer a closed question if multiple answers are possible.
- A list of checkboxes is vertically stacked to enhance readability and usability.
- A list of checkboxes should be in a \`fieldset\` with a \`legend\` describing what the list is about.
  For example, if the checkboxes are used to get answers to a question, the \`legend\` is the question.

## Checkbox labels

A label starts with a capital letter.
It does not have punctuation at the end if it is a single sentence, word, or fragment.
It is written in the first person when asking the user to agree to the terms and conditions.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html): It is clear for both users and programmatically what the purpose of a form field is.

Checkbox is an interactive element; therefore, [the general requirements and guidelines for interactivity](/docs/docs-developer-guide-interactivity--docs) apply.
