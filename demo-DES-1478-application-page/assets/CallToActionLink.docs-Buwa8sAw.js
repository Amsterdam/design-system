# Call to Action Link

A link that stands out and encourages the user to take action, such as starting to fill in a form.

## Design

The Call to Action Link features a green background to ensure it stands out.
To clarify that it is not a button, which is not suitable for navigation, its text is underlined like links typically are.
This informs users that a new page will open and that they can either copy the link or open it in a new window.

## Guidelines

- Use a Call to Action Link to guide the user to a page where they can perform an action.
- A single page must not have more than one Call to Action Link.
  Ensure the emphasis is on one product, and divide the content into several pages if needed.
- Use the verb’s infinitive form, such as “Kapotte parkeerautomaat melden”, not “Meld kapotte parkeerautomaat”.
- For additional guidelines, refer to the [Link](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) component.
