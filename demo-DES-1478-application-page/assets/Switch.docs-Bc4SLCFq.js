# Switch

A switch is a control element to toggle between two different states quickly.
A switch applies to a page or the entire system, such as an on/off switch.

## Guidelines

- A Switch must have a label, and in most cases, this label should be visible.
- Switch only between two different states.
  It is a binary action.
- The action takes place immediately when the user operates the switch.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html): it is both clear for a user and programmatically what the purpose of a form field is.

Switch is an interactive element, and the [general requirements and guidelines for interactivity](/docs/docs-developer-guide-interactivity--docs) apply.
