# Footer

Provides service information at the bottom of every page.

## Guidelines

The Footer must be used on all websites and applications for the City of Amsterdam.
It includes the logo of the City or the organization, the site title (except for the general website), and a menu with links to commonly used pages.
The Footer is important because it conveys our corporate identity and is the first thing people see.
Using it consistently helps users recognize and trust the website.
It is the same on every page of the application.

- The first column focuses on contact information.
  The information is as specific as possible and tailored to the respective website or page (e.g., including a chat option if available).
- The second column contains links to relevant (online) sites or sources.
- The third column refers to newsletters, social media, etc.
- The last part of the footer is intended for links to privacy policies, cookie statements, explanations about the website, etc.
  It is not intended for links to contact information, for example.
