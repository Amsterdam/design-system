# React Switch Component

The React `<Switch />` component is a wrapper around the `<input type="checkbox" />`.
It can be used as a standalone component or as a form control element.
When used as a standalone component provide a `aria-labelledby` prop to keep it accessible.
When used as a form control, make sure to add the associated `<Label>` component.
