# React Switch Component

The React `<Switch />` component is a wrapper around the `<input type="checkbox" />`. It can be used as a standalone component or as a form control element. When used as a standalone component provide an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop to keep it accessible. When used as a formcontrol, make sure to add the associated `<FormLabel>` component.
