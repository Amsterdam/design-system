# Amsterdam Design System: React components

The `@amsterdam/design-system-react` package contains React implementations of various components.
You can use this package in React apps.

The design tokens and CSS used in these components are published in separate npm packages,
so don’t forget to install and include `@amsterdam/design-system-tokens` and `@amsterdam/design-system-css` too.

## Stability of the components

The React Library has not yet reached a 1.0.0 version.
However, most of them are stable enough to be used in production.
Components that have known issues, or for which we anticipate API changes, show a ‘beta’ badge on their page.

Make sure you specify the exact version as dependency.
You can then schedule an upgrade to the latest version when you have time to test for regressions.
