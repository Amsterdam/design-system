# Coding Conventions

## Where to put properties for various states

The declaration block for the pseudo-class name only lists the properties for which the value changes in the related state. Properties that remain unchanged in all other states are part of the declaration block for the general class name, even if they don’t affect the element’s initial state.

### Do this

This link receives an underline when a user's pointer hovers over it. Still, we define its thickness and offset for the initial state.

```css
.amsterdam-link {
  text-decoration: none;
  text-decoration-thickness: 2px;
  text-underline-offset: 3px;

  &:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

### Do not do this

```css
.class {
  text-decoration: none;

  &:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-thickness: 2px;
    text-underline-offset: 3px;
  }
}
```
