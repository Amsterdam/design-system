# Description List

A collection of terms and their descriptions.

## Design

On a narrow screen, descriptions appear indented below their term.
From the medium breakpoint, terms and descriptions appear next to each other.
The column for the descriptions is twice as wide as the one for the term.
The term is set in bold text.
