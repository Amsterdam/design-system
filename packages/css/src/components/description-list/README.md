# Description List

A collection of terms and their descriptions.

## Design

In a narrow window, descriptions appear indented below their term.
After that, they display in a two-column layout.
The column for the terms is as wide as the longest term, without wrapping.
Its width can be adjusted to be ‘large’ (50%), ‘medium’ (33%), or ‘small’ (20%), which also allows the terms to wrap.

The term is set in bold text.
