# Field

Wraps a single input and its related elements. May indicate that the input has a validation error.

## Guidelines

- Only use Field to wrap a single input. Use [Field Set](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) to wrap multiple inputs.
- There’s no need to add white space between the children of a Field. The component does this automatically.
