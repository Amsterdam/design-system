# Button

Allows the user to perform actions and operate the user interface.

## Guidelines

- A short label text that describes the function of the button.
- A clear contrasting colour scheme so that it is easy to recognize and quickly locate.
- Use the correct type of button for the corresponding application.
  For example, a button within a form must always be of the type `submit`.
- Make sure one can operate a button through a keyboard.
- Primary, secondary and tertiary buttons can be used side by side.
  Skipping levels is allowed.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG requirement 2.1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard-no-exception):
  You can activate the button with `Enter` or `Space`, and it is possible with ‘Tab’ the button to focus.
  Using `Space` does not result in scrolling the page.
- [WCAG requirement 2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#headings-and-labels): the label of the button must be clear
- [WCAG requirement 2.5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pointer-cancellation):
  - do not use the `mousedown` event to activate the button, instead use the `click` event
  - `mousedown` may only be used if `mouseup` undoes the effect, for example, a “fast forward” button to fast-forward audio or video.
- [WCAG requirement 2.5.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#target-size): The button must be large enough to click, and small buttons should not be too close to another button.
