# Tabs

Tabs are used to bundle related content in a compact overview within a page. Each tab has a short name, and these names indicate the relationship between the information displayed in each tab.

## Guidelines

- The content of each tab is viewable independently, not in the context of one another.
- The content within each tab should have a similar structure.
- Use when there is limited visual space and content needs to be divided into sections.
- Each tab consists of a button and a panel.
  A `tab` prop with a corresponding value connects them.

You can navigate tabs with your keyboard:

| key            | element                                        |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Enter or Space | Open or close the tab that has the focus       |
| Tab            | Go to the next element that can have focus     |
| Shift + Tab    | Go to the next element that can have focus     |
| Left arrow     | If the tabs have focus: go to the previous tab |
| Right arrow    | If the tabs have focus: go to the next tab     |
| Home           | If the tabs have focus: go to the first tab    |
| End            | If the tabs have focus, go to the last tab     |

### Caution

Do not use tabs if the content in each tab functions just as well on separate pages.
