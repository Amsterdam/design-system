# Screen

Manages the maximum width and alignment of the entire website or application.

## Guidelines

- This should be the outermost component of your website or application.
- Within it, combine components such as
  [Grid](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-layout-grid--docs),
  [Header](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-containers-header--docs),
  [Page Footer](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-containers-page-footer--docs),
  [Spotlight](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-containers-spotlight--docs),
  [Image Slider](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-media-image-slider--docs),
  and [Figure](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-media-figure--docs).

## Design

By default, this component expands to a width of 1600 pixels.
This is the maximum width for a website of the City of Amsterdam.
For applications, you can choose a larger maximum width of 2112 pixels.
The component horizontally centres both itself and its content.
