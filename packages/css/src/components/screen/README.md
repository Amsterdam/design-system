# Screen

Manages the maximum width and alignment of the entire website or application.

## Guidelines

- This should be the outermost component of your website or application.
- Within it, combine components such as
  [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs),
  [Header](/docs/components-containers-header--docs),
  [Footer](/docs/components-containers-footer--docs),
  [Spotlight](/docs/components-containers-spotlight--docs),
  and Figure.

## Design

By default, this component expands to a width of 1600 pixels.
This is the maximum width for a website of the City of Amsterdam.
For applications, you can choose a larger maximum width of 2112 pixels.
The component horizontally centres both itself and its content.
