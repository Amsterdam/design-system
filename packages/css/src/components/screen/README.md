Manages the maximum width and alignment of the entire website or application.

## Usage

This should be the outermost component of your website or application.
Within it, combine components such as
[Grid](?path=/docs/react_layout-grid--docs),
[Header](?path=/docs/react_containers-header--docs),
[Footer](?path=/docs/react_containers-footer--docs),
[Spotlight](?path=/docs/react_containers-spotlight--docs),
and Figure.

## Design

By default, this component expands to a width of 1600 pixels.
This is the maximum width for a website of the City of Amsterdam.
For applications, you can choose a larger maximum width of 2112 pixels.
The component horizontally centres both itself and its content.
