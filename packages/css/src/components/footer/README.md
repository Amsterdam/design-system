# Footer

Provides service information at the bottom of every page.

## Guidelines

- The Footer consists of two sections: a full-width blue area and a [Page Menu](/docs/components-navigation-page-menu--docs) below it.
  It must be used on all websites for the City of Amsterdam.
- The Footer is the same on every page of the application.
- For applications, only the Page Menu can be sufficient.

The top section offers space for various practical links:

- The first column focuses on contact information.
  The information is as specific as possible and tailored to the respective website or page (e.g., including a chat option if available).
- The second column contains links to relevant (online) sites or sources.
- The third column refers to newsletters, social media, etc.

The menu in the bottom section is for links to privacy policies, cookie statements, information about the website itself, etc.
Contact details should not go here.
