# Pagination

Pagination is a navigation element used to navigate between multiple pages of overview lists.
This is commonly used for search results or a list of news articles.
In cases where overview lists are too long to display on a single page, pagination can provide a clearer and more functional way to divide the content across multiple pages.
Pagination indicates the current page and allows users to navigate to other pages.

## Guidelines

- Use pagination only when an overview list is too long to display on a single page.
- Place pagination below the overview list.
- Pagination should not be displayed if there is only one page.
- Redirect users to the first page if they enter a URL with a page number that doesn’t exist.
- Pagination can be combined with a count at the top of the page indicating “Page # of ##.”
- Start a page with an overview list at the top after changing the page.
- Make sure that the visible and accessible labels for the ‘previous’ and ‘next’ buttons convey the same meaning at all times – e.g. don’t update one and forget the other.

## Relevant WCAG rules

Pagination is an interactive element, and the [general requirements and guidelines for interactivity](/docs/docs-developer-guide-interactivity--docs) apply.
