# Pagination

Pagination is a navigation element used to navigate between multiple pages of overview lists.
This is commonly used for search results or a list of news articles.
In cases where overview lists are too long to display on a single page, pagination can provide a clearer and more functional way to divide the content across multiple pages.
Pagination indicates the current page and allows users to navigate to other pages.

## Guidelines

- Use pagination only when an overview list is too long to display on a single page.
- Place pagination below the overview list.
- Pagination should not be displayed if there is only one page.
- Redirect users to the first page if they enter a URL with a page number that doesn’t exist.
- Pagination can be combined with a counter at the top of the page indicating “Page # of ##.”
- Start a page with an overview list at the top after changing the page.

## Relevant WCAG Rules

Pagination is an interactive element, and the [general requirements and guidelines for interactive elements](https://amsterdam.github.io/design-system/?path=/docs/docs-designrichtlijnen-interactieve-elementen--docs) apply.
