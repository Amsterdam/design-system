# Visually Hidden

Hides content from sighted users but keeps it accessible to non-visual user agents, such as screen readers.

## Guidelines

- In most cases, visually available content should be accessible to non-visual user agents and vice versa.
- Elaborate instructions or guidance read only by non-visual user agents can do more harm than good.
