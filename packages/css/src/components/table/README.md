# Table

Use the table component to let users compare information in rows and columns.
Table is used to display simple information that does not need to be filtered or edited.

## Guidelines

- Use `<Table.Caption>` to describe a table in the same way you would use a heading.
  A caption helps users find, navigate and understand tables.
- Never use the table component to layout content on a page.
  Instead, use [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
