# Table

Use the table component to let users compare information in rows and columns.
Table is used to display simple information that does not need to be filtered or edited.

## Guidelines

- Add a caption to help users find, navigate and understand the table.
- Include a [Heading](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-text-heading--docs) in the Table Caption,
  unless the table is in a [Figure](http://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-media-figure--docs) which has a Figure Caption.
