# Search Field

Allows users to quickly find relevant content by entering a (part of a) word or phrase to search through the content.

## Guidelines

- Users can initiate a search by using the search button or the Enter key.

## Autofocus

You can use `autofocus` to place focus directly on a search field when the user arrives on a page.
However, use this feature with caution, as it can have negative consequences:

- For screen reader users, this may result in skipping important content above the search field.
- On smaller devices, the use of `autofocus` may automatically scroll the page to the search field, potentially causing users to miss previous content.
- On touchscreen devices, this can trigger the keyboard to appear immediately, hiding important content.

Use `autofocus` only if the search field is at the beginning of a page and there are no other elements on a page that a user might want to interact with first.

## `autocomplete` and `spellcheck`

Both `autocomplete` and `spellcheck` are turned off by default.
These features can be disruptive for a user searching for part of a word, and `autocomplete` may interfere with an Autosuggest component.

## Relevant WCAG Requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships): `role="search"` is used for the search landmark role.
- [WCAG 1.3.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#identify-input-purpose): It is clear both to the user and programmatically what the purpose of a form field is.
- [WCAG 2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#headings-and-labels): There is a label describing the purpose of the input.

Search Field is an interactive element; therefore, [the general requirements and guidelines for interactivity](/docs/docs-developer-guide-interactivity--docs) apply.
