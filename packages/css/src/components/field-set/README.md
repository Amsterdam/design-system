# Field Set

A component to group related form inputs.

## Guidelines

- Use Field Set when you need to show a relationship between multiple form inputs. For example, you may need to group a set of text inputs into a single Field Set when asking for an address.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html): Field Set labels the purpose of a group of inputs.
