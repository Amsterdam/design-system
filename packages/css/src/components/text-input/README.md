# Text Input

A form field in which a user can enter text.

## Guidelines

- Use a Text Input when users need to enter a single line of text, such as their name or phone number.
- Do not use a Text Input when users could provide more than 1 sentence of text.
- The width of the Text Input should be appropriate for the information to be entered.
- A Text Input must have a Label, and in most cases, this label should be visible.
- Use `spellcheck="false"` for fields that may contain sensitive information, such as personal data.
  Some browser extensions for spell-checking send this information to external servers.
- Apply automatic assistance where possible.
  For example, in logged-in systems, pre-filling known values can prevent errors and save time.
