# Badge

A prominent label that indicates a category, property or instruction.

## Guidelines

- Let the badge contain a short text or a number.
- Use any of the feedback or highlight [colours](/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs) for the background.
  The default is green.
  Red, orange and green are especially useful for showing an error, warning, or success.
  However, they can also be combined with the other colours without carrying these meanings.
- The default text colour (black) is used on an azure, lime, orange or yellow background.
  The inverse text colour (white) is used on a green, magenta, red or purple background.
- Blue is not an option because it is used exclusively to indicate interactivity.
