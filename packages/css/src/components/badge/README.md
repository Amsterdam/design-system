# Badge

A prominent label that indicates a category, property or instruction.

## Guidelines

- Let the badge contain a short text or a number.
- Use any of the feedback or highlight [colours](/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs) for the background.
  The default is green.
  Red, orange and green are especially useful for showing an error, warning, or success.
  However, they can also be combined with the other colours without carrying these meanings.
- [The correct text color](?path=/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs#pairing-foreground-with-background-colours) against the chosen background is set automatically.
