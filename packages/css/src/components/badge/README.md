# Badge

A prominently coloured box containing 1 or 2 words.
Guides the user in taking a specific action or describes its surrounding content.

## Design

- The badge can contain a short text or a number.
- Any [colour](/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs) from the ‘highlight’ and ‘feedback’ groups can be used for the background.
  The default is green.
  The design system does not define a meaning to any of these background colours, although it makes sense to use green and red for positive and negative feedback.
- The default text colour (black) is used on an azure, lime, orange or yellow background.
  The inverse text colour (white) is used on a green, magenta, red or purple background.
- Blue is not an option because it is used exclusively to indicate interactivity.
