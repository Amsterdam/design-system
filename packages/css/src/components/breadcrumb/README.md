# Breadcrumb

The breadcrumb is a secondary navigation pattern that helps a user understand the structure between levels in the website up to the current page.
Users can use it to navigate.

## Guidelines

- Only use the breadcrumb trail if it adds something functional for the user and the structure is ‘static’.
- Do not display the breadcrumb trail on a form page.
  It distracts the user from their task, or one can accidentally interpret it as a Progress Indicator.
- This is a secondary navigation pattern.
  It can’t replace the main navigation.
