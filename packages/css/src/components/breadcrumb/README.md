# Breadcrumb

The breadcrumb is a secondary navigation pattern that helps a user understand the structure between levels in the website up to the current page.
Users can use it to navigate.

## Guidelines

### Use like this

Only use the breadcrumb trail if it adds something functional for the user and the structure is ‘static’.

### Avoid this

Do not display the breadcrumb trail on a form page.
It distracts the user from their task, or one can accidentally interpret it as a Progress Indicator.

It is a secondary navigation pattern.
It can’t replace the main navigation.

### Using links with third-party routers

Check out the [developer guide](/docs/docs-developer-guide-using-links-with-routers--docs) on how to integrate links with external routing solutions.
