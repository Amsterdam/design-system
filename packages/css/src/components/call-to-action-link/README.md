# Call to Action Link

A link that stands out and encourages the user to take action, such as starting to fill in a form.

## Design

The Call to Action link has a green background with white text, making it visually distinct from other links and buttons.
To help distinguish it from a button, which is inappropriate for navigation, the text has been underlined.
This aims to make people aware that a new page will load, and that they can copy the link or open it in a new window.

## Guidelines

- Only use a Call to Action Link to direct the user to an action.
  Use it sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user with too many calls to action.
  More than one Call to Action Link on a page should be an exception.
- Use the infinitive form of the verb in the link text, such as "Kapotte parkeerautomaat melden", not "Meld kapotte parkeerautomaat".
- For additional guidelines, refer to the [Link](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) component.
