# Link List

A collection of related links.

## Design

Every list item starts with a chevron.
It emphasizes the list structure and thematic coherence.
The chevron is part of the link.
Therefore, it is blue and clickable.

## Guidelines

- Use a Link List to present multiple links within a theme.
- For additional guidelines, refer to the [Link](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) component.
