# Alert

An Alert informs the user of a significant or time-sensitive message without interrupting their task.

## Guidelines

- Use an Alert if the messageâ€™s purpose matches one of the following:
  - **Information** to bring attention to a message.
    This variation is blue and it is the default.
  - **Success** to reassure that a process is complete.
    This variation is green.
  - **Warning** when action is needed to prevent damage.
    This variation is orange.
  - **Error** indicates an error has occurred.
    This variation is red.
- Place the Alert in a Grid Cell to create enough white space around it.
- Important and urgent information is to be placed directly below the Header.
  Examples: system outage or changes in the opening hours of a City Office.
  This can be applied to the entire application or to a part of it.
- Add a close button to allow the user to dismiss the Alert.
