# Alert

An Alert informs the user of a significant or time-sensitive message without interrupting their task.

## Specifications

There are four types of notifications:

- **Warning** (orange) when action is needed to prevent damage.
- **Error** (red) indicates an error has occurred.
- **Confirmation** (green) to reassure that a process is complete.
- **Notification** (blue) to bring attention to a message.

## Guidelines

- Place an orange Alert directly below the Header for important and urgent information.
  Examples: system outage or changes in the opening hours of a City Office.
- Ensure sufficient white space around the Alert.
  The grid’s white space is a good reference – place the Alert in its own cell.
- By default, the Alert cannot be closed.
  This functionality can be added optionally.
