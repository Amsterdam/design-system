# Spotlight

Emphasizes a section on a page through a distinctive background colour.

## Guidelines

- Display the Spotlight at the entire width of the [Page](/docs/components-containers-page--docs) container; do not position it on the [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
- Add a Grid with medium vertical padding inside the Spotlight to add whitespace around the content, even for a single element.
- Use any of the [highlight colours](/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs) for the background.
  The design system does not prescribe a meaning to any of these colours.
  The default is purple.
- Select [the correct colour](?path=/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs#pairing-foreground-with-background-colours) for text and links against the background you choose.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum): Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
