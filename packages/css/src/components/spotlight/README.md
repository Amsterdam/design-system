# Spotlight

Emphasizes a section on a page through a distinctive background colour.

## Guidelines

- Display the Spotlight at the entire width of the [Screen](/docs/components-layout-screen--docs); do not position it on the [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
- Do not use other background colours than the options below.
  The blue appearance of Footer must remain unique – this is why that colour is not an option for Spotlight.
  Red, black and grey aren’t options either.
- The default background is purple, but the colours can be chosen freely – they do not convey a meaning or theme in itself.
- Refer to [this overview on Stijlweb](https://amsterdam.nl/stijlweb/basiselementen/kleuren/#PagCls_15671872) to determine whether you can use black or white text on the background colour of your choice.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum): Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
