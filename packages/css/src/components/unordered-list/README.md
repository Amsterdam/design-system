# Unordered List

A list is a vertical group of related content.
This list can have 2 levels.
The first level consists of squares.
The second level consists of en dashes (â€“).
Text in the list items is indented by a fixed distance.

## Design

Items of an unordered list have square markers.
There is extra white space between the items.
This provides better distinction between the items, especially when they consist of multiple lines of text.
