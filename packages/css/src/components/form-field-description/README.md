# Form Field Description

The `FormFieldDescription` component is used to provide additional information about a form field. This information is typically used to provide context or instructions for the form field.

## Described by

The description can be associated with a form field using the `aria-describedby` attribute. This attribute is used to reference the `id` of the `FormFieldDescription` component.
