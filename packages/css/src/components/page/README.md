# Page

Contains the entire website.
Sets the background colour and its maximum width, and is horizontally centered.

## Guidelines

- The Page component must be used on all websites for the City of Amsterdam.
  Applications can use it as well, although a specific layout for them is in development.
- It is the outermost container. Within it, combine components such as
  [Grid](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-layout-grid--docs),
  [Page Header](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-containers-page-header--docs),
  [Page Footer](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-containers-page-footer--docs),
  [Spotlight](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-containers-spotlight--docs),
  [Image Slider](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-media-image-slider--docs),
  and [Figure](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-media-figure--docs).

## Design

The Page container sets the maximum width for a website of the City of Amsterdam, which is 1600 pixels.
It horizontally centres both itself and its content and sets a white background.
