# Page Heading

The page heading component is a prominent text at the beginning of a page, immediately after the header.
Use this component for a name, title, or motto.

## Guidelines

- Use this component to capture the userâ€™s attention.
- Limit this component to once per page, typically only on the homepage.
- Avoid using it if you need to display long pieces of text; the text should be short and precise.

## Relevant WCAG Requirements

The page heading component is a variant of a heading level 1 with a distinct style.
When using this component, ensure that the heading hierarchy of the page remains logical.

For this component, the same WCAG requirements apply as for [the heading component](https://amsterdam.github.io/design-system/?path=/docs/react_text-heading--docs).
