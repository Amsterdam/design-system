# Progress List

Displays the progress of a sequence of steps, with optional additional details per step.

## Guidelines

- Choose the correct level for the steps’ headings.
- Assign a status to each step: _completed_ or _current_.
  Steps without a status are considered _upcoming_.
- Maintain a correct chronological order.
  Only one step may be _current_; preceding steps must be _completed_.
- Use the Progress List only on a white background.
  This is a limitation of the current implementation.
