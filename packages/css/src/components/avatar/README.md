# Avatar

A circular badge representing a person.

## Design

- The avatar contains 1 or 2 initial letters from the personâ€™s full name, a picture, or a generic icon.

## Guidelines

- Show an avatar for the user of the application, or to associate a person with a content item.
- To personalize the Avatar, the user can be allowed to choose one of the [highlight colours](/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs).
  The default is purple.
  The design system does not define a meaning to any of these background colours.
