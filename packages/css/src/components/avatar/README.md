# Avatar

A prominently coloured circular button containing two initials of a currently logged-in user.

Clicking or tapping the button would typically open a context menu or view with information and actions related to the user.

## Design

The avatar contains two initial letters from the user's full name.
The default background colour is dark blue.
Suggestions on when to use the other colours will follow soon.
