# Avatar

A circular badge representing a person.

## Design

- The avatar contains 1 or 2 initial letters from the person’s full name, a picture, or a generic icon.
- To personalize the Avatar, the user can be allowed to choose one of the [colours](/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs) from the ‘highlight’ group.
  The default is purple.
  The design system does not define a meaning to any of these background colours.
- The default text colour (black) is used on an azure, lime, orange or yellow background.
  The inverse text colour (white) is used on a green, magenta or purple background.
- Blue is only an option for an interactive Avatar, which we expect to add in the future.

## Guidelines

- Show an avatar for the user of the application, or to associate a person with a content item.
