# Image

Displays an image.

## Guidelines

- Do not forget to include a description of the image in the `alt` attribute.
  This ensures that screen reader users can also access this information.
  Additionally, it can aid in search engine optimization.
- A description is unnecessary for decorative images; use `alt=""` for these.
  Examples are images that add little to the nearby text or pictures that purely contribute to the design or atmosphere of the page (source: [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)).
- Optionally specify multiple candidates for the image through the `srcSet` attribute.
  For example, provide small, medium, and large variants for various screen sizes.
  This prevents unnecessary downloading of large files.
  Do this especially for the main image of a page, where the difference between sizes on a narrow and wide screen is most significant.
- Ensure that the aspect ratio of the image is supported by the [Aspect Ratio](?path=/docs/layout-aspect-ratio--docs) component.
