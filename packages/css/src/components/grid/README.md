# Grid

Divides the screen into columns to align the elements of a page.

## Guidelines

- Every page should use the grid as the foundation for its layout.
  It is placed directly within the [Page](/docs/components-containers-page--docs) container.
- A [Page Footer](/docs/components-containers-page-footer--docs) and a [Spotlight](/docs/components-containers-spotlight--docs) are slightly wider than the grid.
  You close one instance of the grid before these components.
  Inside and optionally after them, you start a new one.
  Multiple instances of the grid component are possible on a page, but the columns of all grids must align precisely.
- Within the grid, you create cells containing the desired content.
  A cell often spans multiple columns of the grid.
- The Gap utility classes must not be used on the Grid component.

## Design

The [design choices](/docs/brand-design-tokens-grid--docs) are described in the general documentation.
