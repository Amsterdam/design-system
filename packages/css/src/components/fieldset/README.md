# Fieldset

A component to group related form inputs.

## Guidelines

- Use Fieldset when you need to show a relationship between multiple form inputs. For example, you may need to group a set of text inputs into a single fieldset when asking for an address.
- When grouping radio inputs, use `role="radiogroup"` on Fieldset to have this grouping explicitly announced as a radio group. Fieldset has a default role of `group`.

## Relevant WCAG Requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html): Fieldset labels the purpose of a group of inputs.
