# Aspect Ratio

Aspect Ratio updates the height of an element with its width.

These are the proportions we use:

| keyword   | ratio |
| :-------- | ----: |
| `2x-wide` |  16:5 |
| `x-wide`  |  16:9 |
| `wide`    |   5:4 |
| `square`  |   1:1 |
| `tall`    |   4:5 |
| `x-tall`  |  9:16 |

## Guidelines

- Use this component to constrain images, videos and other elements to one of the available aspect ratios.
