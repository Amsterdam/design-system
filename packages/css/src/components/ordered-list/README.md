# Ordered List

An ordered list is a vertical group of related content with an order.
This list can have 2 levels.
The first level has numbers as list markers.
The second level uses letters in alphabetical order.
List items indent their text by a fixed distance.

## Design

The list uses ascending numbers as markers, providing enough space for numbers up to 99.
Extra white space between items enhances the distinction, mainly when they consist of multiple lines of text.
