# Heading

Introduces a page section and describes the following content.

## Guidelines

- All headings together represent the document’s structure. Users of screen readers may use headings to navigate the page – an incorrect hierarchy will confuse them.
- Every page should contain one heading with level 1.
  The level of subsequent headings should be appropriate: a subsection must use one level higher than the section it belongs to.
  The `level` prop doesn’t have a default value; the correct level should be determined for each instance.
- Search engines give more weight to text in headers.
- Don’t use a Heading only to produce its appearance.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#qr-content-structure-separation-programmatic):
  Text that looks like a heading is also recognized as a heading by a computer.
  Using the correct heading level makes the page structure clear for all users.
- [WCAG 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#qr-navigation-mechanisms-skip): Headings can be used to navigate to the next section with the keyboard.
- [WCAG 2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels): Use headings to describe the purpose or subject of the underlying content.
- [WCAG 2.4.10](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#qr-navigation-mechanisms-headings): Use headings to structure the content.
