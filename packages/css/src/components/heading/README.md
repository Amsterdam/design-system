# Heading

Describes the content that follows it.
Use Headings to allow the user to grasp the structure of the page quickly.

## Guidelines

- A heading describes the content beneath it.
- Every page should contain one Heading with level 1.
- Do not skip heading levels, e.g. a level 2 Heading should be followed by one with level 3, not level 4.
- Do not use a Heading for formatting and styling, but to represent the page’s structure.
  Users of screen readers use headings to navigate the page – an incorrect hierarchy can confuse them.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#qr-content-structure-separation-programmatic):
  Text that looks like a heading is also recognized as a heading by a computer.
  Using the correct heading level makes the page structure clear for all users.
- [WCAG 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#qr-navigation-mechanisms-skip): Headings can be used to navigate to the next section with the keyboard.
- [WCAG 2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#headings-and-labels): Use headings to describe the purpose or subject of the underlying content.
