# Heading

Introduces a page section and describes the following content.

## Guidelines

- Use Headings to allow the user to quickly grasp the structure of the page.
- All headings together represent the document’s structure. Users of screen readers may use headings to navigate the page – an incorrect hierarchy will confuse them.
- Every page should contain one heading with level 1.
  Do not skip heading levels, e.g. a level 2 Heading should be followed by one with level 3, not level 4.
  The `level` prop doesn’t have a default value; the correct level should be determined for each instance.
- Don’t use a Heading just for its visual appearance.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

  Text that looks like a heading is also recognized as a heading by a computer.
  Using the correct heading level makes the page structure clear for all users.
