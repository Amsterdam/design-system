# Time Input

Helps users enter time.

## Visual considerations

This component uses a native time input, which is styled differently in different browsers and operating systems.
Recreating the native functionality is quite difficult and prone to accessibility errors, which is why weâ€™ve chosen not to do that.
This does mean that this component does not look identical on all browsers and operating systems.
