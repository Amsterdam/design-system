# Column

Stacks its children vertically and adds a vertical gap between them.

## Design

The default vertical column gap has the same length as the default horizontal grid gap.
Consequently, the vertical whitespace is fluid as well, depending on the width of the window.
Five widths are available, ranging from a quarter of the default to double the width.
