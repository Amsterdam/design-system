# Page Footer

Provides service information at the bottom of every page.

## Guidelines

- The Page Footer must be used on all websites for the City of Amsterdam.
- It must be the same on every page of the website.

### Content

- This section is required for public websites, but not for internal ones.
  It offers space for various practical links:
  - The first column focuses on contact information.
    Make it specific and tailor it to the website or page.
  - The second column contains links to other relevant sources.
  - The third column refers to newsletters, events, social media, etc.
- Set [the inverse colour](?path=/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs#pairing-foreground-with-background-colours) on all text and links in this area.
- If the Page Footer contains [Headings](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-text-heading--docs), give them level 2 and a size of ‘level-3’.
  A visually hidden heading to group them is not necessary – the footer’s landmark provides enough guidance.

### Menu

- The menu is for links to privacy policies, cookie statements, and other information about the website itself.
- It includes a visually hidden heading to provide structural context for screen reader users.
  The default heading text is ‘Over deze website’.
  Customize it when the menu serves a different purpose, or the interface language is not Dutch.
