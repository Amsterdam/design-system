# Page Footer

Provides service information at the bottom of every page.

## Guidelines

- The Page Footer usually consists of two sections: a full-width blue `PageFooter.Spotlight` and a `PageFooter.Menu` below it.
- Both sections are preceded by a visually hidden `Heading` for accessibility.
- A Page Footer containing only a `PageFooter.Menu` can be sufficient for applications.
- The Page Footer must be used on all websites for the City of Amsterdam.
- It must be the same on every page.

The top section offers space for various practical links:

- The first column focuses on contact information.
  The information is as specific as possible and tailored to the respective website or page (e.g., including a chat option if available).
- The second column contains links to relevant (online) sites or sources.
- The third column refers to newsletters, social media, etc.

The menu in the bottom section is for links to privacy policies, cookie statements, information about the website itself, etc.
Contact details should not go here.
