# Date Input

Helps users enter a date.

## Guidelines

- Use the date input component when you’re asking users for a date they’ll already know, or can look up without using a calendar.
- Do not use the date input component if users are unlikely to know the exact date of the event you’re asking about.

## Visual considerations

This component uses a native date input, which is styled differently in different browsers and operating systems.
Recreating the native functionality is quite difficult and prone to accessibility errors, which is why we’ve chosen not to do that.
This does mean that this component does not look identical on all browsers and operating systems.
