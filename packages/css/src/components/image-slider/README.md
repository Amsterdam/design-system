# Image Slider

Displays a small set of images in a limited space.

## Design

The first or selected image shows at its maximum size.
Every image displays a thumbnail at about 20% of its width.
Users can use buttons, thumbnails or swiping to navigate between the images.
The buttons re not displayed on a narrow touch device.
The images do not slide automatically.

## How to use

- Use this for a series of images that belong together.
- Feature the most essential image first.
- Display the Image Slider at the entire width of the [Screen](/docs/components-layout-screen--docs); do not position it on the [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
- Provide at least 2 images but at most 5.
- Assume that some or many users will not use the Slider and only see the first image.
  Display all images separately if you want each of them to receive attention.
- Consult the [Image](/docs/components-media-image--docs) docs for guidelines on the individual images.
