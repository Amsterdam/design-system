# Page Menu

A small set of links for use in the Header and Footer.

## Guidelines

- Limit the amount of menu items in the Header to 5 items or less, including ‘Search’ and ‘Menu’.
- The menu should fit on a single line and is right-aligned.
- The menu in the footer is left-aligned.
- Submenus are not allowed.
- The ‘Menu’ button opens the Mega Menu.
- On narrow screens, menu items other than ‘Search’ and ‘Menu’ move from the Page Menu to the Mega Menu.

### Using links with routing libraries
