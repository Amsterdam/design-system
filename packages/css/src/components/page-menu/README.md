# Page Menu

A small set of links for use in the Header and Footer.

## Guidelines

- Limit the amount of menu items in the Header to 5 items or less, including ‘Search’ and ‘Menu’.
- The menu in the Header aligns to the end; the one in the Footer aligns to the start.
- Submenus are not allowed.
- The ‘Menu’ button in the Header opens the Mega Menu.
- On narrow screens, menu items other than ‘Search’ and ‘Menu’ move from the Page Menu to the Mega Menu.
- Labels should be short so that the menu wraps to multiple lines only if necessary.
- If a very well-known icon exists for the function of a link or button, it can be added at the end of it.

### Using links with routing libraries

Check out the [developer guide](/docs/docs-developer-guide-routing-libraries--docs) on how to integrate links with external routing libraries.
