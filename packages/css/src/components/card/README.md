# Card

Use a card on an overview page to link to an article page, such as a news article, a job vacancy, or a search result.
The card typically includes the title, introduction, and an image of the content.
The link is mandatory.

## Guidelines

- The title of a card is a link within a heading.
  The same guidelines as for regular [links](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) and [headings](/docs/components-text-heading--docs) apply here.
  The link is active across the entire area of the card.
- A card needs more content than just a title.
  Supplement this with textual and/or visual content.
- Place the text in a regular paragraph.
  Only use the smallest text size for a tagline or date.
- This component may not be the best option if the content does not represent a detailed page.
  For referencing a thematic page, use a [top task link](/docs/components-navigation-top-task-link--docs).
  You can also use a [regular link](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs).

## Screen readers

With a screen reader, you can navigate using headings and links in a document.
The title of a card is a link within a heading, allowing you to utilize both navigation methods.
A screen reader reads the title first, followed by the rest of the content.
