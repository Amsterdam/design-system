# Standalone Link

A navigation element that is seperated from the text around it.

## Guidelines

- Use a Standalone Link for links that need to stand out.
  Within sentences or paragraphs of text, use a regular [Link](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) instead.
- For additional guidelines, refer to the [Link](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) component.
