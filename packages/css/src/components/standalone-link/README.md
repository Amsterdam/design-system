# Standalone Link

A navigation element that is separated from the text around it.

The Standalone Link has a chevron icon at the start to signify that it is a link.
This also makes it visually identical to a single link in a [Link List](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs).
As a result, pages can have sections with either one or several links used interchangeably; they look alike, and their semantics are correct.

## Guidelines

- Use a Standalone Link for a single link on its own line of text.
- Within running body text, use a regular Link instead.
- For additional guidelines, refer to the [Link](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) component.
