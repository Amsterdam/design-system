# Blockquote

We use blockquotes to emphasize citations.
A quote appears differently from the main text to make it stand out.

## Guidelines

- Quote someoneâ€™s literal written or oral text.
- A quote has a width of half or a whole column of text.
- The component adds the correct quotation marks.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

- [WCAG 3.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-parts.html): if the citation is in a language other than that of the surrounding content, indicate so through the `lang` attribute.
