# Header

Arranges the Cityâ€™s logo, the title of the website, and a page menu.

## Guidelines

- Use the Header when the site is hosted on amsterdam.nl or one of its subdomains.
- The page menu can contain a maximum of 5 items, including menu and search.
- When you have a long subsite title, use no or as few page menu items as possible.
