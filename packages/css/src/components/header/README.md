# Header

Establishes the City of Amsterdam as the official source of the website or application.
Contains the main and secondary navigation and optionally a site-wide title.

## How to use

The Header must be used on all websites and applications for the City of Amsterdam.
One objective of the Header is to convey our corporate identity.
Using it consistently helps users recognize and trust our websites.
Within a website, the Header must be the same on every page.

Both navigation menus support variations in the amount and grouping of links to accommodate websites of varying sizes and information architectures.

The component does not render a `header` HTML element by default.
If the Header triggers a Main Menu, both should be in the `header` â€“ best through a `<Grid as="header">`.

See [Mega Menu](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-navigation-mega-menu--docs) and [Page Menu](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-navigation-page-menu--docs) for more guidelines.
