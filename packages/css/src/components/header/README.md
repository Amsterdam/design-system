# Header

Displays the City’s logo at the top of every page, and optionally a secondary navigation menu.
Includes the name of the application if it is not the general website.

## Guidelines

The Header must be used on all websites and applications for the City of Amsterdam.
It includes the logo of the City or the organization, the site title (except for the general website), and a menu with links to commonly used pages.

The Header is important because it conveys our corporate identity and is the first thing people see.
Using it consistently helps users recognize and trust the website.
It is the same on every page of the application.

The page menu can contain a maximum of 5 items.
The last two will often be ‘Search’ and ‘Menu’.
Labels should be short to ensure the menu fits on one line, even on medium-wide screens.
An icon can be added to the end of a link to make its function easier to find.
