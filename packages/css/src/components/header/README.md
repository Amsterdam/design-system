# Header

Displays the City’s logo and a navigation menu at the top of every page.
Includes the name of the application if it is not the general website.

## Guidelines

The Header must be used on all websites and applications for the City of Amsterdam.
It includes the logo of the City or the organization, the site title (except for the general website), and a menu with links to commonly used pages.
The Header is important because it conveys our corporate identity and is the first thing people see.
Using it consistently helps users recognize and trust the website.
It is the same on every page of the application.

The Page Menu should contain no more than 5 items, including ‘Search’ and ‘Menu’.
