# Header

Displays the City’s logo at the top of every page, and optionally a navigation menu.
Includes the name of the application if it is not the general website.

## Guidelines

- The Header must be used on all websites and applications for the City of Amsterdam.
- It includes the logo of the City or the organization, the site title (except for the general website), and a menu with links to commonly used pages.
- The Header is important because it conveys our corporate identity and is the first thing people see.
  Using it consistently helps users recognize and trust the website.
- The Header is the same on every page of the application, although full-screen pages may hide it, e.g. a video or a map.
- The inline menu can contain a maximum of 5 items.
  The last two will often be ‘Search’ and ‘Menu’.
- The 'Menu' button opens a collapsible menu, which has room for more links.
- On narrow windows, links can move from the inline menu to the collapsible one.
- Labels should be short to help the inline menu fit on a single line whenever possible.
- An icon can be added to the end of a link to make its destination easier to guess.
