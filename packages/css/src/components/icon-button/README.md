# Icon Button

An icon in a button that can be aligned with text.

## Guidelines

- Choose an Icon Button instead of a regular [Button](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-buttons-button--docs) if it must align with text.
  Match the size of the Icon Button to that text.
- Use this button only if the icon is entirely clear and understandable.
  Many icons are interpreted differently by different users.
  Only use universally recognized icons, such as a close icon or a play icon.
  For other icons, use a Button to allow the user to read its label.
- Icon Button still needs a label to describe the button to users of screen readers.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

The Icon Button follows [the same requirements and guidelines as a regular button](/docs/components-buttons-button--docs).
