# Icon Button

A button containing only an icon.

## Guidelines

- Use this button only if the icon is entirely clear and understandable.
  Many icons are interpreted differently by different users.
  Only use universally recognized icons, such as a close icon or a play icon.
- Provide a label text that describes what the button does for screen reader users.

## Relevant WCAG Requirements

The Icon Button follows [the same requirements and guidelines as a regular button](/docs/components-buttons-button--docs).
