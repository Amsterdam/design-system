# Top Task Link

A prominent navigation element to quickly start a task.

## Guidelines

- A Top Task Link has both a title and a description.
- The title describes the essence of the page being referred to, attracting attention when scanning the page.
- The description provides more context, helping the user confirm that they can indeed achieve their goal on the linked page.
- Keep both texts concise.
  A title consists of a few words, and the description consists of 1 or 2 short sentences.
  The description should end with a period or another appropriate punctuation mark.
- For wide windows, place 3 or 4 Top Task Links side by side on the [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
  If you have more Top Task Links, place them in the next row.
  Try to distribute the amount of links on wide windows over rows of 3 or 4 links.
  If this is not possible, leave the last cells of the grid empty.
- If you have a group of links for which a description is unnecessary or illogical, use a [Link List](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs).

### Using links with routing libraries

Check out the [developer guide](/docs/docs-developer-guide-routing-libraries--docs) on how to integrate links with external routing libraries.

## Relevant WCAG requirements

The Top Task Link is subject to the same requirements as [regular links](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs).
