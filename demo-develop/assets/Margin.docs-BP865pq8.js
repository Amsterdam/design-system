# Margin

Adds white space below a single element.

## Class names

Six options are available for the width or height of the bottom margin:

- \`ams-mb-xs\`
- \`ams-mb-s\`
- \`ams-mb-m\`
- \`ams-mb-l\`
- \`ams-mb-xl\`
- \`ams-mb-2xl\`

Because spacing is responsive, the margins are as well.
They are also smaller in [Compact Mode](https://designsystem.amsterdam/docs/docs-developer-guide-modes--docs).
Consult the [Space](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs) docs for an indication of their sizes.

## Guidelines

- Use this utility class to vertically separate one element from the next.
- It can be used on any element and sets the \`margin-block-end\` CSS property.
  This declaration is marked with the \`!important\` flag to ensure it overrides any other margins.
- Elements’ top and bottom margins are sometimes collapsed into a single margin.
  We only offer a utility for the bottom margin to prevent issues arising from this.
  Consult [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) for details.
- To add equal margins between elements, either use the [Gap](/docs/utilities-css-gap--docs) utility class on their common parent or wrap them in a [Column](/docs/components-layout-column--docs) component.
  This helps in loops: it prevents having to treat the last element differently.
