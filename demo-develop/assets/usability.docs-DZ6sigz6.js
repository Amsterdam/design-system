For single-page applications (SPAs) this isn’t always done consistently.

The simplest and most consistent way to do this is to set focus on the `,e.jsx(t.code,{children:"<body>"}),` element after navigating to another page.
For some applications it might make more sense to set the focus somewhere else,
but be very careful with this.
Your assumptions on how users use the app might not be correct.
Only change the expected focus behaviour when user tests show it’s an improvement,
