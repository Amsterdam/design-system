# Checkbox

Allows users to make a selection or agree to terms.

## Guidelines

- Checkboxes are used for one or multiple choices that do not exclude each other.
- Each checkbox operates independently of other checkboxes in a list at the same hierarchical level.
  Checking an additional checkbox does not affect other selections in that list.
- You can use a checkbox for bulk selection or deselection of an entire list of checkboxes.
  Still, it should be clear that the bulk selection checkbox is at a different hierarchical level than the list being fully selected or deselected.
- Use a group of checkboxes to filter data on a page, in a menu, or within a component.
- A checkbox can answer a closed question if multiple answers are possible.
- A list of checkboxes is vertically stacked to enhance readability and usability.
- A list of checkboxes should be in a \`fieldset\` with a \`legend\` describing what the list is about.
  For example, if the checkboxes are used to get answers to a question, the \`legend\` is the question.

## Checkbox Labels

A label starts with a capital letter.
It does not have punctuation at the end if it is a single sentence, word, or fragment.
It is written in the first person when asking the user to agree to the terms and conditions.

## Relevant WCAG Requirements

- [WCAG 1.3.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html): It is clear for both users and programmatically what the purpose of a form field is.

Checkbox is an interactive element; therefore, [the general requirements and guidelines for interactive elements](/docs/docs-design-guidelines-interactive-elements--docs) apply.
`;function o(t){const n=Object.assign({h2:"h2",h3:"h3"},s(),t.components);return e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx(i,{of:h}),`
`,e.jsx(a,{children:m}),`
`,e.jsx(r,{}),`
`,e.jsx(l,{}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h2,{id:"examples",children:"Examples"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h3,{id:"long-label",children:"Long label"}),`
`,e.jsx(c,{of:d})]})}function M(t={}){const{wrapper:n}=Object.assign({},s(),t.components);return n?e.jsx(n,Object.assign({},t,{children:e.jsx(o,t)})):o(t)}export{M as default};
