# Pages

This section demonstrates how to compose pages with the Design System’s components.
It uses the latest versions of the libraries, without any customizations.
This gives an honest representation of what they can achieve and how they work in the browser.

## Documentation

We offer examples for various page types; see the list in the sidebar.

The ‘Docs’ page for each page explains its design decisions and how to build it.

## Examples

The ‘Default’ example shows the actual page in its entirety.
Some page types have more than one example.

### Flexible content

Reload an example to get new random texts and images.
Use the ‘Control’ tab to see how it looks with your own content.

### Test for accessibility and see HTML output

The ‘Accessibility’ tab offers a report of various automatic tests.
The ‘HTML’ tab displays the entire document as rendered by all components on the page.

### Check how the page would look on various devices

The buttons in the toolbar offer various features, of which the ‘three-layered square’ button replicates the appearance and behaviour of the page on a phone, tablet or desktop.
Press the button with the two arrows to rotate the screen.

### See the page full-screen

Use the ‘Go to full screen’ (or press `alt+F`) or ‘Open canvas in new tab’ buttons to the top right to see the entire page.
