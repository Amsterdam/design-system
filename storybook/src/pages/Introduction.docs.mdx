# Introduction

This section demonstrates how to build entire pages using the Design System’s components.

We offer a home page, an article page and a form for the upcoming Amsterdam.nl website.

As an example of an application created with our libraries, we have two pages for ‘Amopis’.
This contains some customizations for features we don’t yet support.

## Documentation

The ‘Docs’ page explains the design decisions for this type of page and how to build it.

## Examples

Each example, of which the first is called ‘Default’, shows the actual page in its entirety.

### Flexible content

Reload an example to get new random texts and images.
Use the Control tab to experiment with your own content.

### Test for accessibility and see HTML output

The ‘Accessibility’ tab offers a report of various automatic tests.
The ‘HTML’ tab displays the entire HTML-document rendered by all components on the page.

### Check how the page would look on various devices

The buttons in the toolbar offer various features, of which the ‘three layered square’ button replicates the appearance and behaviour of the page on a phone, tablet or desktop. Press the button with the two arrows to rotate the screen.

### See the page full-screen

Use the ‘Go to full screen’ (or press `alt+F`) or ‘Open canvas in new tab’ buttons to the top right to see the entire page.
Alternatively, press `alt+S,T,A` to hide the three panels.
