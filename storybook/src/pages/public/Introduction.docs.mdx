# Public websites

The City maintains numerous websites for various target audiences: citizens, entrepreneurs and visitors.
This section presents a number of page types for websites of which Amsterdam is the primary sender, and the intended audience is the general public or a specific part of it.

## Spacious Mode

Public websites must use the default Spacious Mode, which applies generous
[typography](/docs/brand-design-tokens-typography--docs) and [spacing](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs).
This appearance keeps the focus on the content.
It makes information easy to read and helps users find what they need without distractions.

## Page structure

The general structure for a page is:

```tsx
<Page>
  <SkipLink href="#inhoud">Direct naar inhoud</SkipLink>
  <PageHeader>
    <Grid />
  </PageHeader>
  <Grid>
    <Breadcrumb />
  </Grid>
  <Grid as="main" id="inhoud">
    …
  </Grid>
  <PageFooter>
    <PageFooter.Spotlight>
      <Grid />
    </PageFooter.Spotlight>
    <PageFooter.Menu />
  </PageFooter>
</Page>
```

### No Menu

Public websites cannot use the [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) component.
They should offer navigation using the Page Header only.

## How to size the Grid Cells

Everything on the page is wrapped in a [Grid Cell](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
Its `span` and `start` props let you define where all sections go on the page.
Do so for all variants of the Grid (narrow, medium, and wide: 4, 8, and 12 columns).

Some typical page sections always use the same values:

### Content page header

The header section contains the page title, publication date, optional metadata, and the lead paragraph.
It is a bit **wider** than the body section and is positioned slightly further **to the left**.

```tsx
<Grid.Cell span={{ narrow: 4, medium: 7, wide: 9 }} start={{ narrow: 1, medium: 1, wide: 2 }} />
```

Breadcrumbs use their own Grid placed directly above the header, using the same cell configuration.

### Content page body

The body section contains the main textual content of the page.
It spans **7 columns** on the wide grid and **6 columns** on the medium-wide grid to maintain an optimal line length for readability.
This also applies to forms.

```tsx
<Grid.Cell span={{ narrow: 4, medium: 6, wide: 7 }} start={{ narrow: 1, medium: 2, wide: 3 }} />
```

### Side-by-side blocks

Link Blocks (a section with a header, paragraph, and standalone link) can be displayed **side by side**, for example within a Spotlight.
To achieve this, use the following configuration.
The `start` prop is not needed here.

```tsx
<Grid.Cell span={{ narrow: 4, medium: 4, wide: 6 }} />
```

On navigation pages, similar sections use Link Lists and are 1 column **narrower**.
When rendering them in a loop, the `start` position is only necessary for the odd cells:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell span={{ narrow: 4, medium: 4, wide: 5 }} start={index % 2 ? undefined : { narrow: 1, medium: 1, wide: 2 }} />
```

### Top tasks

Top-task overviews use Cards that contain only a heading and a paragraph, without an image.
On the wide grid, each Card spans 3 columns, fitting **4 per row**.
On the narrow and medium-wide grids, each Card spans 4 columns.
The `start` prop is not needed here.

```tsx
<Grid.Cell span={{ narrow: 4, medium: 4, wide: 3 }} />
```

### Preview cards

Index pages such as news overviews or search results use Cards as well for navigation.
They usually do include the image of the target content.
These layouts require **4 columns** for each Card, which can be achieved with a single spanning value:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell span={4} />
```
