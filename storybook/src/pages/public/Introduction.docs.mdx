# Public websites

The City maintains numerous websites for various target audiences: citizens, entrepreneurs and visitors.
This section presents a number of page types for websites of which Amsterdam is the primary sender, and the intended audience is the general public or a specific part of it.

## Spacious Mode

Public websites must use the default Spacious Mode, which applies generous
[typography](/docs/brand-design-tokens-typography--docs) and [spacing](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs).
This appearance keeps the focus on the content.
It makes information easy to read and helps users find what they need without distractions.

## No Menu

Public websites cannot use the [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) component.
They should offer navigation using the Page Header only.
