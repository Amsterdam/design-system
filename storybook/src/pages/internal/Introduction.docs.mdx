# Internal applications

Backoffice applications, used by the City’s staff rather than available for the public,
The design system also supports internal and backoffice applications.

These applications typically require higher information density and faster task execution.
The guidelines below describe how to apply the system in these contexts.

## Compact Mode

Internal applications frequently use Compact Mode, which applies reduced sizes for [typography](/docs/brand-design-tokens-typography--docs) and [spacing](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs).
This mode increases information density and improves the use of available screen space.

Compact Mode automatically adjusts all components.
As a result, they remain consistent and equally suitable for task-oriented workflows as they are for content-driven public websites.

## Page structure

The general structure for a page is:

```tsx
<Page withMenu>
  <SkipLink className="ams-page__area--skip-link" href="#inhoud">
    Direct naar inhoud
  </SkipLink>
  <PageHeader className="ams-page__area--header" noMenuButtonOnWideWindow>
    <Menu />
  </PageHeader>
  <Menu className="ams-page__area--menu" inWideWindow />
  <main className="ams-page__area--body" id="inhoud">
    <Grid />
  </main>
  <PageFooter className="ams-page__area--footer" />
</Page>
```

### Positioning classes

All children of `Page` have a class name starting with `ams-page__area--` to lay them out correctly on the underlying grid.

### With menu

Internal applications may use a [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) to support navigation across major functional areas or modules.
This pattern helps users move efficiently between different parts of the application while keeping the structure clear and predictable.

The component must be rendered twice.

1. One instance, for narrow and medium windows, sits in the Page Header.
   The user can access it through the menu button.
   Hide the menu button on wide windows.
2. A second Menu goes between the Page Header and the main content.
   This is for wide windows, where the menu is positioned to the side.
   The `inWideWindow` prop ensures that only one of both components is present at all times.

Make sure that both menus have the same items.
