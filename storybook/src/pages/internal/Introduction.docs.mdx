Internal applications will often use Compact Mode (which features smaller values for
[typography](/docs/brand-design-tokens-typography--docs) and
[space](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs).

## With menu

They can also use the [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) component to let the user navigate between large modules of the app.
