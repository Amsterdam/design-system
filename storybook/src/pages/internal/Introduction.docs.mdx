# Internal websites

The design system also supports internal websites, e.g. backoffice systems used by our staff.

These typically require higher information density and faster task execution.
The guidelines below describe how to apply the design in these contexts.

## Compact Mode

Internal websites frequently use [Compact Mode](/docs/docs-developer-guide-modes--docs), which applies reduced sizes for [typography](/docs/brand-design-tokens-typography--docs) and [spacing](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs).
This mode increases information density and improves the use of available screen space.

Compact Mode automatically adjusts all components.
As a result, they remain consistent and equally suitable for task-oriented workflows as they are for content-driven public websites.

## With menu

Internal websites may use a [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) to support navigation across major functional areas or modules.
This pattern helps users move efficiently between different parts of the website while keeping the structure clear and predictable.
