# Home page

The content for the home page of an internal application depends very much on the application itself.
Our example currently focuses on the overall layout.

## Layout

A typical layout for an application:

```tsx
<Page hasMenu>
  <SkipLink className="ams-page__area--skip-link" href="#inhoud">
    Direct naar inhoud
  </SkipLink>
  <PageHeader className="ams-page__area--header" noMenuButtonOnWideWindow>
    <Grid>
      <PageHeader.GridCellNarrowWindowOnly span="all">
        <Menu />
      </PageHeader.GridCellNarrowWindowOnly>
    </Grid>
  </PageHeader>
  <Menu className="ams-page__area--menu" inWideWindow />
  <main className="ams-page__area--body" id="inhoud">
    <Grid />
  </main>
  <PageFooter className="ams-page__area--footer" />
</Page>
```

### Positioning classes

All children of `Page` have a class name starting with `ams-page__area--` to lay them out correctly on the underlying grid.

### Two instances of Menu

The [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) component must be rendered twice.

1. One instance, for narrow and medium windows, sits in the Page Header.
   The user can access it through the menu button.
   Hide the menu button on wide windows through the `GridCellNarrowWindowOnly` subcomponent.
2. A second Menu should go between the Page Header and the main content.
   This is for wide windows, where the menu is positioned to the side.
   The `inWideWindow` prop ensures that only one of both components is present at all times.

Make sure that both menus have the same items.
