# Navigation page

A navigation page does not have much content of its own.
Instead, it presents groups of links to various pages related to a specific subject.

## Headings

- Use a level 1 Heading for the page title.
- Set a size of ‘level-3’ to the headings in Link Blocks (those with a Paragraph, Standalone Link and/or a Link List).
  Card Headings already set this by default.
- If multiple Cards and Link Blocks are grouped into a section, update their Heading levels accordingly.

## Spacing

- Grids on this page type use the default x-large vertical gap.
