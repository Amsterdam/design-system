# Form Flow

These examples describe a user-friendly form flow.
Form pages have a minimal header and footer in order to remove distractions.
Start with asking [one thing per page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page).
This can be a single question, or a group of related questions.

## Landing Page

Most form flows start with a landing page that explains the process and provides a call to action to start the form flow.

## With One Question

On a form page with one question, the questions label or legend is the level 1 heading of the page.
For labels, wrap the `h1` around it.
For legends, wrap it around the `h1`.

For more information, see [Making labels and legends headings](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/labels-legends-headings/).

## With Multiple Questions

When a form page has multiple questions, define an `h1` outside the `form`-tag,
which describes the question group.

For more information, see [Question pages - Asking complex questions without using hint text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#asking-complex-questions-without-using-hint-text)
