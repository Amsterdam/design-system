# Project page

Communicates all relevant public information about a construction or traffic project.
Its primary purpose is to inform residents and stakeholders clearly, consistently, and transparently.

The page follows a fixed content structure.
It contains a set of prose sections that explain what the project is, where it takes place, why it is necessary, and when it is planned or executed.
This standardisation ensures comparability across projects and improves findability for users.

The When section typically includes a timeline of key milestones, presented by a [Progress List](/docs/components-containers-progress-list--docs).
This provides a concise overview of the project’s current status and upcoming phases.

Visual content supports the textual explanation.
Large images are used to provide context or illustrate impact.
A map shows the project location and affected area.
When relevant, an embedded video may be included to explain complex situations or planned changes.

Related information is grouped in link blocks.
These link to news updates, related projects, and supporting documents, enabling users to explore additional detail without overloading the main narrative.
