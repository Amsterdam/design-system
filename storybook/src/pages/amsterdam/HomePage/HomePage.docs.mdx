# Home page

The starting page of an application generally provides a broad overview of subjects, common tasks, and recent articles.

## Layout

A typical layout for a homepage:

```tsx
<Screen>
  <SkipLink href="#main">Direct naar inhoud</SkipLink>
  <Grid>
    <Header />
  </Grid>
  <main id="main">
    <Overlap>
      <Search />
    </Overlap>
    <Grid>
      <AppComponent1 />
      <AppComponent2 />
      <AppComponent3 />
    </Grid>
  </main>
  <Footer>
    <Grid />
  </Footer>
</Screen>
```

1. The Skip Link prevents users from having to pass all preceding navigation links.
2. The Screen component sets a maximum width for the entire page.
3. The Grid divides the available width into 4, 8, or 12 columns.
4. The Header shows the logo and menus for the application.
5. The main element wraps everything between Header and Footer.
   It carries an id for the skip link to target.
6. An Overlap stacks a Search Field on a background Image.
   It is as wide as the Grid, hence it is a sibling of it.
7. Other components in the main area are laid out on a Grid again.
8. The Footer contains its own Grid.
   This allows its background colour to stretch to the Screenâ€™s width.
