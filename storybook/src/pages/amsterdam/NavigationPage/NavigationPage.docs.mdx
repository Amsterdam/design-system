# Navigation page

A navigation page does not have much content of its own.
Instead, it presents groups of links to various pages related to a specific subject.

## Headings

- Use a level 1 Heading for the page title.
- Use the default size of 4 for Card Headings and give them level 2 if they follow the page heading directly, or 3 if there is a section heading in between.
- Headings in compositions with a Paragraph and a Standalone Link or a Link List should get size 4 as well, along with the appropriate semantic level.

## Spacing

- Grids on this page type use the default x-large vertical gap.
