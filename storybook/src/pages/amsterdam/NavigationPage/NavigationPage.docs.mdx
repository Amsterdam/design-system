# Navigation page

A navigation page does not have much content of its own.
Instead, it presents groups of links to various pages related to a specific subject.

## Headings

- Use a level 1 Heading for the page title.
- All Card Headings and Headings in compositions with a Paragraph and a Standalone Link or a Link List get size 3.
  This is already the default for Card Headings.
  Give them level 2 and size 3 if they follow the page title directly.

## Spacing

- Grids on this page type use the default x-large vertical gap.
