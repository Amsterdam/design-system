# Form page

Most form flows start with a landing page that explains the process and provides a call to action to start the form.
The form pages themselves have a minimal header and footer in order to remove distractions.
Start with asking [one thing per page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page).
This can be a single question, or a group of related questions.

Follow these guidelines:

- [Gov.uk on question pages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/)
- [NL Design System on forms](https://nldesignsystem.nl/richtlijnen/formulieren/)
