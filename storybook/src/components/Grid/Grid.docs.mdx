## Examples

The grey strokes in the examples on this page indicate the columns of the grid.
The gaps between the columns are white – note that they can be wider than the columns.
Pink boxes represent cells on the grid.

### Vertical padding

Add white space above and below the grid through the `padding…` props.
This is useful on a coloured background, like [Footer](/docs/components-containers-footer--docs) or [Spotlight](/docs/components-containers-spotlight--docs), or between two consecutive grids.
Specify a value of `medium` for vertical white space as wide as the horizontal.
Use `small` for half that width and `large` for double.
This padding is responsive as well.

### Vertical gap

A grid automatically creates a new row if the next cell doesn’t fit the current one.
White space between rows is as wide as that between columns.
Use the `verticalGap` prop to make it larger, smaller, or even remove it.

### Span columns

A cell defaults to spanning 1 column in the grid.
Use the `span` prop to make a cell span more columns.

### Span responsively

You can make the number of columns a cell spans depend on the window width.
Use the `span` prop with 3 values for narrow, medium, and wide windows.
E.g. `span={{ narrow: 4, medium: 6, wide: 8 }}` makes the cell span all 4 columns on narrow windows, 6 of the 8 on medium windows, and 8 of the 12 on wide windows.

### Span all columns

To stretch the cell to all columns of the grid – whether that are 4, 8, or 12 – use `span="all"`.

### Start position

Each cell automatically starts in the next available position in the grid.
Adjust the starting position of a cell with the `start` prop.
This way, you can align cells in multiple rows or center a cell horizontally.
It can also skip a column for more white space between cells.

The starting position of a cell may also depend on the window width.
Use the `start` prop with 3 values, e.g. `start={{ narrow: 2, medium: 4, wide: 6 }}`.

### Improve semantics

By default, a Grid Cell renders a `<div>` element in HTML.
Use the `as` prop to make your markup more semantic.

## Guidelines

- Ensure that the number of columns you assign to a cell matches the amount of columns in the grid for the respective window width.
- The same applies to starting a cell in a later column.
- If the total of both values is too large, the browser adds columns to the grid.
  This is not allowed.
