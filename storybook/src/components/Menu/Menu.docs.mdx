## Examples

The Menu component is designed to be used in the sidebar of interal applications.
Usually with a blue background. This first iteration is a simple vertical menu with 1 level of navigation.

### Link

<Canvas of={MenuStories.Link} />

<Controls of={MenuStories.Link} />

### On a coloured background

A Link on a coloured background must set [the correct text colour](?path=/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs#pairing-foreground-with-background-colours) to provide enough contrast.
We have lighter and darker background colours, and links behave differently on each.

#### Contrast colour

Use the contrast colour on a lime, orange or yellow background.
It will make the Link black.

<Canvas of={MenuStories.ContrastColour} />

#### Inverse colour

Use the inverse colour on an azure, blue, green, magenta or purple background.
It will make the Link white.
