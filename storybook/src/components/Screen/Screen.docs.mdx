import { Canvas, Controls, Markdown, Meta, Primary } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as ScreenStories from "./Screen.stories.tsx";

<Meta of={ScreenStories} />

<Markdown>{README}</Markdown>

## Example

There’s not much to see in the example.
On a wide screen, or when zooming out, you’ll notice that the width of the pink box gets limited by the maximum width of the Screen component.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Structure

The outer containers of your website will look like this:

```jsx
<Screen>
  <PageHeader />
  <Grid />
  <Spotlight />
  <Grid />
  <Figure />
  <Footer />
</Screen>
```
