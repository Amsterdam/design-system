import { Canvas, Controls, Markdown, Meta, Primary } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as ScreenStories from "./Screen.stories.tsx";
import README from "../../../../packages/css/src/components/screen/README.md?raw";

<Meta of={ScreenStories} />

<Markdown>{README}</Markdown>

## Example

There’s not much too see in the example – on a wide screen, or when zooming out, you’ll notice that width of the pink indicator is limited by the maximum width of the Screen component.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Structure

The outer containers of your website will look like this:

```jsx
<Screen>
  <Header />
  <Grid />
  <Spotlight />
  <Grid />
  <Figure />
  <Footer />
</Screen>
```
