## Examples

### Responsive images

Provide a set of smaller and larger instances of the image (through `srcSet`, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset)) to let the browser select the optimal source file.
A mobile device can often download a smaller file, saving the user’s bandwidth and time.
Don’t forget to still include the required `src` attribute.

### Lazy loading

Set the `loading` attribute (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#loading)) to `lazy` and the browser will wait to load the image until it is close to the viewport.
Consider setting this for images below the top area of the page.
