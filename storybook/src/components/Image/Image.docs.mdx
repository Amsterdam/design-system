## Examples

### Provide multiple sources

Use the srcSet prop, which controls the corresponding HTML attribute (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset)), to let the browser select the optimal source file for the image.
A mobile device can often download a smaller file, saving the user’s bandwidth and time.
Don’t forget to still include the required `src` attribute.

### Prevent unnecessary loading

Set the `loading` attribute (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#loading)) to `lazy` and the browser will wait to load the image until it is close to the viewport.
Consider setting this for images below the top area of the page.
