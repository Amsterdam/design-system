## Examples

### Large text

Use this size only for the lead paragraph of a page.
It is not mandatory to use a lead paragraph, but there must be no more than 1 per page.

A lead paragraph introduces the pageâ€™s content.
Use this text to entice the reader to continue reading.

### Small text

Use this size for auxiliary texts, captions, metadata, etc.
Keep these texts short.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.SmallText} />

### Inverse colour

Use the inverse colour if the Paragraph sits on a dark background.
This ensures the colour of the text provides enough contrast.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.InverseColour} />

### With an icon

Use a [Row](/docs/components-layout-row--docs) and the `size` prop of [Icon](/docs/components-media-icon--docs) to align body text with an icon.
