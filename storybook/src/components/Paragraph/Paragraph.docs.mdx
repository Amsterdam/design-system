## Examples

### Large text

Use this size only for the lead paragraph of a page.
A lead paragraph is optional, but there must be no more than one per page.

A lead paragraph introduces the page’s content and encourages the reader to continue.
Its line lengths are automatically balanced to match the visual behaviour of the
[Heading](/docs/components-text-heading--docs) that typically precedes it.

### Small text

We use a smaller font size for text in a Figure Caption and for metadata like dates or categories.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.SmallText} />

### Inverse colour

Use the inverse colour if the Paragraph sits on a dark background.
This ensures the colour of the text provides enough contrast.

### With an icon

Use a [Row](/docs/components-layout-row--docs) and the `size` prop of [Icon](/docs/components-media-icon--docs) to align body text with an icon.
