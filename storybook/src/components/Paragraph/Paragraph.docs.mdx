## Examples

### Large text

Use this size only for the lead paragraph of a page.
It is not mandatory to use a lead paragraph, but there must be no more than 1 per page.

A lead paragraph introduces the pageâ€™s content.
Use this text to entice the reader to continue reading.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.LargeText} />

### Small text

Use this size for auxiliary texts, captions, metadata, etc.
Keep these texts short.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.SmallText} />

### Inverse colour

Set the `inverseColor` prop if the Paragraph sits on a dark background.
This ensures the colour of the text provides enough contrast.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.InverseColour} />
