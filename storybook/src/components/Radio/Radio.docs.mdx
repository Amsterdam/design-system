## Examples

### In a Field Set

Use a Field Set to group several Radios with a legend, description and / or an Error Message.

Add `role="radiogroup"` to the Field Set to have it explicitly announced as a radio group (the default role is just ‘group’).
The ‘radio group’ role also allows using `aria-required` on Field Set; that isn’t allowed for the ‘group’ role.
Even so, always set `aria-required` on the individual Radios as well to ensure that screen readers can read it.

If you don’t need the description, remove its Paragraph and the `aria-describedby` from the Field Set.

Check [the Field Set docs](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) for more information on configuring it.

### In a Field Set with validation

A Field Set with a Radio group can become invalid.
In this case, connect an Error Message to the Field Set.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the Field Set and provide the `id` of Error Message as its value.

Do not use rich text (such as links or lists) in an Error Message. [Find out why](/docs/components-forms-error-message--docs#no-rich-text).

Check [the Field Set docs](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) for more information on configuring it.

### With custom icon

Replace the icon with a custom version to use the Radio in a different theme or visual identity.
Use `ams-radio__circle`, `ams-radio__hover-indicator` and `ams-radio__checked-indicator` classes in its SVG markup.
Applications for the City of Amsterdam must use the default icon.
