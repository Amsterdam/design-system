## Examples

### In a Field Set

Use a Field Set to group several Radios with a legend, description and / or an error message.

Add `role="radiogroup"` to the Field Set to have it explicitly announced as a radio group (the default role is just ‘group’).
The ‘radio group’ role also allows using `aria-required` on Field Set; that isn’t allowed for the ‘group’ role.
Always also set `aria-required` on the individual Radios though, to make sure it’s read by screen readers.

If you don’t need the description, just take out the description Paragraph and the `aria-describedby` from the Field Set.

Check [Field Set](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) for more information on configuring it.

### In a Field Set With Validation

If the Radio can become invalid, add an Error Message component and its `id` to the `aria-describedby` prop of the Field Set.

For more information, check [the Field Set component documentation](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs).
