## Examples

### In a Field Set

Use a Field Set to group several Radios with a legend, description, and / or an error message.

When grouping radio inputs, use `role="radiogroup"` on Field Set to have this grouping explicitly announced as a radio group (the default role is group).
Using `role="radiogroup"` also allows you to use `aria-required` on Field Set, which isn’t allowed for role group.
Always also set `aria-required` on the individual radio buttons though, to make sure it’s read by screen readers.

If you don’t need the description, just take out the description Paragraph and the `aria-describedby` from the Field Set.

For more information, check [the Field Set component documentation](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs).
