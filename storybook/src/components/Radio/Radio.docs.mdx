## Examples

### In a Field Set

Use a Field Set to group several Radios with a legend, description and / or an Error Message.

Add `role="radiogroup"` to the Field Set to have it explicitly announced as a radio group (the default role is just ‘group’).
The ‘radio group’ role also allows using `aria-required` on Field Set; that isn’t allowed for the ‘group’ role.
Even so, always set `aria-required` on the individual Radios as well to ensure that screen readers can read it.

If you don’t need the description, remove its Paragraph and the `aria-describedby` from the Field Set.

Check [the Field Set docs](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) for more information on configuring it.

### In a Field Set with validation

If the Radio can become invalid, add an Error Message component and its `id` to the `aria-describedby` attribute of the Field Set.

Check [the Field Set docs](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) for more information on configuring it.

### Custom icons

It is possible to change the default Radio icon.
This is intended for users who do not work within the City of Amsterdam corporate identity.
If you work for the City of Amsterdam, it is unlikely that you need this.
If you would like to use a custom icon, please contact designsystem@amsterdam.nl.
