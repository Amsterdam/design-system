### On a coloured background

An Icon Button on a coloured background must adjust its foreground colour to provide enough contrast.
We have lighter and darker background colours, and Icon Buttons behave differently on each.
Stijlweb shows [which colours suit which backgrounds](https://amsterdam.nl/stijlweb/basiselementen/kleuren/).
Although they only address headings and paragraphs, the same principle applies to Icon Buttons.

- Set the `contrastColor` prop on a yellow, orange or green background.
  It will make the Icon Button black.
- Use the `inverseColor` prop on a purple or dark blue background.
  It will make the Icon Button white.
- On the other background colours, choose either one, but do so consistently.
- There is no current scenario to set both properties at the same time.
  For now, the 'inverse' appearance will prevail.
