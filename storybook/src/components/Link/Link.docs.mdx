## Examples

### Standalone links

Place standalone links directly after a piece of content.
Don’t use them in sentences or paragraphs.
They should never have an associated icon.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Standalone} />

### Inline links

Use inline links within sentences or paragraphs of text.
An icon can be added to inline links, positioned after the link.
Don’t use too many inline links on the same page, as it may confuse the user.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Inline} />

### On a Coloured Background

A link on a coloured background must adjust its text colour to provide enough contrast.
We have lighter and darker background colours, and links behave differently on each.
Stijlweb shows [which colours suit which backgrounds](https://amsterdam.nl/stijlweb/basiselementen/kleuren/).
Although they only address headings and paragraphs, the same principle applies to links.

- Set the `contrastColor` prop on a yellow, orange or green background.
  It will make the link black.
- Use the `inverseColor` prop on a purple or dark blue background.
  It will make the link white.
- On the other background colours, choose either one, but do so consistently.
- There is no current scenario to set both properties at the same time.
  For now, the 'inverse' appearance will prevail.
