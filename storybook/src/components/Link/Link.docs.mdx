## Examples

### Standalone links

Place standalone links directly after a piece of content.
Don’t use them in sentences or paragraphs.
They should never have an associated icon.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Standalone} />

### Inline links

Use inline links within sentences or paragraphs of text.
An icon can be added to inline links, positioned after the link.
Don’t use too many inline links on the same page, as it may confuse the user.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Inline} />

### On a coloured background

A Link on a coloured background must set [the correct text colour](?path=/docs/brand-design-tokens-colour--docs#pairing-foreground-with-background-colours) to provide enough contrast.
We have lighter and darker background colours, and links behave differently on each.

#### Contrast colour

Use the contrast colour on a lime, orange or yellow background.
It will make the Link black.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.ContrastColour} />

#### Inverse colour

Use the inverse colour on an azure, blue, green, magenta or purple background.
It will make the Link white.
