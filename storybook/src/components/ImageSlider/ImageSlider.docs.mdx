## Examples

### Responsive images

Provide a set of smaller and larger instances for every image (through `srcSet`, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset)) to let the browser select the optimal source file.
A mobile device can often download a smaller file, saving the user’s bandwidth and time.
Don’t forget to still include the required `src` attribute.

### Various aspect ratios

The images can have different aspect ratios.
The selected image gets centered, while the thumbnails stretch vertically.
Note that portrait images can become very tall.
In this case, wrap the slider in a sufficiently narrow Grid Cell.
