## Examples

### Responsive images

Provide a set of smaller and larger instances for every image (through `srcSet`, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset)) to let the browser select the optimal source file.
A mobile device can often download a smaller file, saving the user’s bandwidth and time.
Don’t forget to still include the required `src` attribute.
