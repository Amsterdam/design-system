## Examples

### With tagline

A card can display a tagline above the heading, a short term like a category or type of information.
Wrap the tagline and the heading in a `Card.HeadingGroup`.
This ensures screen readers first read the heading and then the tagline.

### With image

A card often displays the [image](/docs/components-media-image--docs) of the detail page.
It must use one of the available [aspect ratios](/docs/brand-design-tokens-aspect-ratio--docs).

<Canvas of={CardStories.WithImage} />

### Top tasks

A set of cards can be used to present links to frequently accessed interactions.
A short title and description are enough to guide the user to the page they need.
Position 4 to 8 tasks on a [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
For a group of links without a description, use a [Link List](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) instead.
