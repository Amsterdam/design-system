## Examples

### With tagline

A Card can display metadata in a tagline above the heading, like a category or content type.
Wrap the Heading in a Heading Group and set its `tagline` property.
This ensures screen readers read out the heading before the metadata.

### With image

A Card often displays the image of the article it links to.
The Card Image subcomponent renders an [Image](/docs/components-media-image--docs) component and accepts its properties, e.g. to set an aspect ratio or provide a set of image sources.
Only use decorative images with `alt=""` here. Screen readers will not read the `alt` text of non-decorative images when navigating to a Card.

### Top tasks

A set of cards can be used to present links to frequently accessed interactions.
A short title and description are enough to guide the user to the page they need.
Position 4 to 8 tasks on a [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs); left-align them and do not skip cells.
For a group of links without a description, use a [Link List](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs) instead.
