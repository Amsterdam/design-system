## Examples

### With tagline

A Card can display metadata in a tagline above the heading, like a category or content type.
Wrap the Heading in a Heading Group and set its `tagline` property.
This ensures screen readers read out the heading before the metadata.

### With image

A Card often displays the image of the article it links to.
The Card Image subcomponent renders an [Image](/docs/components-media-image--docs) component and accepts its properties, e.g. to set an aspect ratio or provide a set of image sources.
An `alt` text is almost never necessary for the image of a card.
