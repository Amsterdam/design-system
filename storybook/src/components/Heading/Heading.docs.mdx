## Examples

### Levels

We’ve limited the number of heading levels to four.
More detailed content should probably be split into multiple pages or have some sections merged.

#### Level 1

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Level1} />

#### Level 2

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Level2} />

#### Level 3

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Level3} />

#### Level 4

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Level4} />

### Sizes

Sometimes, it may be visually more suitable to make a heading appear a bit smaller.
The `size` prop can be used for this.
Do so sparingly; the sizes have been designed to match their semantic level.
Ensure that you still select a level that accurately represents the section’s hierarchy.
These, for example, are all Headings at level 2, but with sizes 1 to 5:

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Sizes} />

### Inverse colour

Use the inverse colour if the Heading sits on a dark background.
This ensures the colour of the text provides enough contrast.

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.InverseColour} />

### With an icon

Headings can be paired with an icon.
Use a [Row](/docs/components-layout-row--docs) and the `size` prop of [Icon](/docs/components-media-icon--docs) to align them.

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.WithIcon} />
