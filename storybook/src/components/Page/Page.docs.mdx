## Examples

### With menu

Internal applications can add a [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) for navigating between its modules and pages.
This is an alternative to the approach using Link Lists, which is appropriate for content-oriented websites.

<Canvas of={PageStories.WithMenu} />

See the [Internal Home Page](/story/pages-internal-home-page--default) template for a full-page example.
