## Examples

### With menu

Internal websites can add a [Menu](/docs/components-navigation-menu--docs) for navigating between its modules and pages.
This is an alternative to the approach using Link Lists, which is appropriate for public, content-oriented websites.

<Canvas of={PageStories.WithMenu} />

See the [Home Page](/story/pages-internal-home-page--default) template for internal websites for a full-page example.

### With background colour

We’re experimenting with a less harsh shade of white for the background colour.
Go to the story page and choose varying background colours.
You can test multiple page templates.

<Canvas of={PageStories.WithBackgroundColour} />
