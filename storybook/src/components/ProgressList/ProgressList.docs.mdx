## Examples

### With substeps

A step may contain a list of substeps.
They are visually subordinate to their parent step: their indicators are smaller, and they do not display a heading.
If needed, headings can still be added into their content.
Substeps must use a heading level one lower than that of the parent steps.

Don’t forget to set the `hasSubsteps` prop on the parent step.
