## Examples

### With placeholder

A Search Field can have a placeholder text.

<Canvas of={SearchFieldStories.WithPlaceholder} />

### Controlled component

By default, the search field is not managed by React but by the browser.
However, it can be controlled by React.
If you enter a value in this search field and use the search button or the Enter key, you will receive a notification.

<Canvas of={SearchFieldStories.Controlled} />
