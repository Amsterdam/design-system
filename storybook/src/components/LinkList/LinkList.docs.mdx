## Examples

### Default

The Link List has no props.
It is just a container for the items, rendering a `<ul>` element.

<Primary />

### Custom Icons

Replace the list icon with a more meaningful one to help understand a link more quickly or easily.
Avoid using both semantic and list icons in the same list.

<Canvas of={LinkListStories.CustomIcons} />

### Small Text

In the [Footer](/docs/components-containers-footer--docs), we use small text, also for lists.
Specify this for each item in the list.

<Canvas of={LinkListStories.SmallText} />

### Link

This example of a single link allows using the controls below.
The Link List Link renders both the `<li>` and `<a>` elements.
Any attributes and the `ref` are passed on to the `<a>` element.

<Canvas of={LinkListStories.Link} />

<Controls of={LinkListStories.Link} />

### On a Coloured Background

A link on a coloured background must adjust its text colour to provide enough contrast.
We have lighter and darker background colours, and links behave differently on each.
Stijlweb shows [which colours suit which backgrounds](https://amsterdam.nl/stijlweb/basiselementen/kleuren/).
Although they only address headings and paragraphs, the same principle applies to links.

- Set the `contrastColor` prop on a yellow, orange or green background.
  It will make the link black.
- Use the `inverseColor` prop on a purple or dark blue background.
  It will make the link white.
- On the other background colours, choose either one, but do so consistently.
- There is no current scenario to set both properties at the same time.
  For now, the 'inverse' appearance will prevail.
