### How to use

This component is an extension of `Grid`.
It offers the same props, although `span` and `start` have been renamed to `colSpan` and `colStart`.
Additionally, `BreakoutSpotlight` allows cells to span multiple rows.

The Cell containing the Spotlight must have `has="spotlight"` to extend to the gaps and margins around it.
This prop can be used only on Cells that span all columns of the grid, so `span="all"` is required as well.

The Cell containing the figure must have `has="figure"` to ensure it aligns to the bottom.

The content that doesnâ€™t break out defines the height of the Spotlight.
Ensure that the text is short, or the image tall, to prevent losing the break-out effect.

On narrower screens, let the text move below the image.

<Controls />

## Examples

### Vertical layout

A large figure can be placed at the top of the Spotlight, with related text positioned underneath.
