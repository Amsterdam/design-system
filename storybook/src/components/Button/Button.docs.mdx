## Examples

Primary, secondary and tertiary buttons can be used side by side.
Skipping levels is allowed.

### Primary

The most important call-to-action button.
One primary button may be used per screen.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Secondary

Use the secondary button for less prominent calls to action.
It is possible to use more than 1 secondary button.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Tertiary

Use tertiary buttons for unimportant calls to action â€“ as many as necessary.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Tertiary} />

### Button with an icon

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithIcon} />

### Text wrapping

Keep in mind that the label may occasionally wrap over multiple lines:
a shorter text might be unavailable,
two buttons could sit next to each other on a narrow screen,
or the user has configured a large font on their device.
