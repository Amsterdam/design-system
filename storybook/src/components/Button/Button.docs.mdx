## Examples

### Primary

A primary button draws attention to the most important call to action.
Only one primary Button should be used per screen or, in applications, large section.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Secondary

Use a secondary button for other actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Tertiary

Tertiary buttons can be used to distinguish their importance from secondary buttons.
They are also a good choice for buttons with an icon only.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Tertiary} />

### With an icon

Add an icon if it makes it easier or faster to understand its purpose.
The icon will appear after the label.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithIcon} />

### With an icon at the start

The icon can also appear before the label.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithIconAtStart} />

### With an icon only

A button can even consist of an icon only.
Do this only for icons that are universally recognized.
You must still provide a label â€“ it will be used to make the button accessible.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithIconOnly} />

### Text wrapping

Keep in mind that the label may occasionally wrap over multiple lines:
a shorter text might be unavailable,
two buttons could sit next to each other on a narrow screen,
or the user has configured a large font on their device.
This is fine.
