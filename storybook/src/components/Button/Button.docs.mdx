## Examples

### Primary

The most important call-to-action.
One primary Button may be used per screen.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Secondary

Use the secondary Button for less prominent calls to action.
It is possible to use more than 1 secondary Button.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Tertiary

Use tertiary Buttons for unimportant calls to action â€“ as many as necessary.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Tertiary} />

### Button with a start icon

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.StartIcon} />

### Button with a end icon

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.EndIcon} />

### Button with an icon only

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.OnlyIcon} />

### Text wrapping

Keep in mind that the label may occasionally wrap over multiple lines:
a shorter text might be unavailable,
two buttons could sit next to each other on a narrow screen,
or the user has configured a large font on their device.
This is fine.
