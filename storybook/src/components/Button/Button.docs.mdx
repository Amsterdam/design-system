## Examples

### Primary

A primary button draws attention to the most important call to action.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Secondary

Use a secondary button for other actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Tertiary

Tertiary buttons can be used to distinguish their importance from secondary buttons.
They are also a good choice for buttons with an icon only.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Tertiary} />

### With icon

Add an icon if it makes it easier or faster to understand its purpose.
The icon will appear after the label.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithIcon} />

### With icon before

The icon can also appear before the label.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithIconBefore} />

### With icon only

A button can even consist of just an icon, but only one of our [functional icons](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/brand-assets-icons--docs#functional-icons).
You must still provide a label to describe the button to users of screen readers.
If the icon-only button must align with text, use an [Icon Button](/docs/components-buttons-icon-button--docs) instead.

### Text wrapping

The label may occasionally wrap over multiple lines.
This can happen if no shorter text is available, two buttons sit next to each other on a narrow screen, or the user has configured a large font on their device.
