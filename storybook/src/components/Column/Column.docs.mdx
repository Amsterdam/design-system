## How to Use

- Wrap a Column around a set of elements that need the same amount of white space between them.
- The five sizes of [Component Space](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs) are available for the width or height of the gap.
- To add white space below a single element, you can add a [Margin Bottom](/docs/utilities-css-margin--docs) instead.
- Align the elements horizontally or vertically through the alignment props.

## Examples

### Default

<Primary />

<Controls />

### Alignment

Items in the column can be aligned vertically in several ways:

- **Center**: center items within the column.
- **End**: align items to the bottom of the column – to the bottom.
- **Space Between**: distribute whitespace between items.
- **Space Around**: distribute whitespace around items.
- **Space Evenly**: distribute whitespace evenly around items.

By default, items align to the **start** of the column – at the top.
This option has no class name or prop value.

This example centers three items vertically.

### Horizontal alignment

Items in the column can be aligned horizontally in several ways:

- **Start**: align items to the start of the column. This is the left side in left-to-right languages.
- **Center**: center items within the column.
- **End**: align items to the end of the column. This is the right side in left-to-right languages.

This example centers three items horizontally.

### Use another HTML element

By default, a Column renders a `<div>`.
Use the `as` prop to make your markup more semantic.
In this example, the Column uses a `<section>` element to group the heading and the cards.

<Canvas of={ColumnStories.CustomTagName} />
