## Example

### Hero Image with Search Field

This allows for the use of a mood-setting image as a background.
A [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs) provides horizontal space on both sides and columns for layout.
Note: the library does not yet offer an option to vertically center the form.

<Primary />

#### Guidelines

- First, implement the underlying component.
- Follow [the general guidelines for images](/docs/components-media-image--docs#guidelines).
- Use a sufficiently large image.
  The aspect ratio of 32:9 is most suitable.
