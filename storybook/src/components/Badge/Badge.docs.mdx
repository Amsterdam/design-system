## Examples

### With icon

Include an icon when it provides meaning that isn’t obvious from the text alone, or when it helps with quick recognition.
This may be helpful for statuses, alerts, or categories that users look over instead of reading.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithIcon} />

## Tokens

<DesignTokensTable tokens={tokens} />
