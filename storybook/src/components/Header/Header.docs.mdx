## Examples

### With moving links

Links can move from the inline menu to the collapsible one on narrow windows.
A `MenuLink` is hidden by default on narrow windows.
Use `GridCellNarrowWindowOnly` to show that same link in the collapsible menu on narrow windows.

If you do not want the `MenuLink` to be hidden, use the `fixed` prop.

In this example, ‘English’ moves to the collapsible menu, while ‘Zoeken’ does not.

### Without menu button on wide windows

If you only have a few links, you may not always need a collapsible menu.
Use `noMenuButtonOnWideWindow` to hide the menu button on wide windows.
On narrow windows, the menu button will still be visible,
so do not forget to add the links to the collapsible menu.

### Without menu button

In some cases, a collapsible menu might not be necessary.
If the Header has no `children`, the menu button will not appear.
Remember to use the `fixed` prop if you want the inline menu links to stay in place.

### With custom logo link

The destination and accessible text of the logo link can be customized,
as well as the logo itself.

### With custom texts

The text of the menu button and the accessible navigation description can be customized.
