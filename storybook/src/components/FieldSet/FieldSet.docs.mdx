## Examples

## With Description

A Field Set can have a description.
Make sure to connect this description to the Field Set or a specific input,
otherwise this won’t be read by a screen reader.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the Field Set
and provide the `id` of the describing element as its value.

<Canvas of={FieldSetStories.WithDescription} />

## With Error

A Field Set can indicate whether any of the inputs it contains has a validation error.

<Canvas of={FieldSetStories.WithError} />

### Radio group

Use a Field Set to group radio buttons.
When grouping radio inputs, use `role="radiogroup"` on Field Set to have this grouping explicitly announced as a radio group (the default role is `group`).

Using `role="radiogroup"` also allows you to use `aria-required` on Field Set, which isn’t allowed for role `group`.
Always also set `aria-required` on the individual radio buttons though, to make sure it’s read by screen readers.

### Checkbox group

Use a Field Set to group checkboxes.

Please note: [NVDA has bug](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/12718) which causes it to
not report a description connected to a Field Set when it contains checkboxes.

Try to avoid using descriptions for Field Sets containing checkboxes for this reason.
