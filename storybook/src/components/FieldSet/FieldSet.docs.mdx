## Examples

### With description

A Field Set can have a description.
Make sure to connect this description to the Field Set or a specific input,
otherwise this won’t be read by a screen reader.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the Field Set
and provide the `id` of the describing element as its value.

Do not use rich text (such as links or lists) in descriptions. [Find out why](/docs/components-forms-field--docs#no-rich-text).

### With Hint

A Field Set can indicate whether all of the inputs it contains are optional or required.
Make sure to add `aria-required` to <em>all</em> form elements in the Field Set when they are required.

### With Validation

A Field Set can indicate whether any of the inputs it contains has a validation error.
Use an [Error Message](/docs/components-forms-error-message--docs) to describe the error.
Make sure to connect the Error Message to the correct input in the Field Set,
otherwise it won’t be read by a screen reader.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the input and provide the `id` of Error Message as its value.

Do not use rich text (such as links or lists) in an Error Message. [Find out why](/docs/components-forms-error-message--docs#no-rich-text).

### With Heading in Legend

If the Field Set is the only content on the page, its Legend serves as the main heading as well.
Set `legendIsPageHeading` to include an `h1` element to reflect this.

### With a nested Field Set

A Field Set can be nested inside another Field Set.
Use the `inFieldSet` prop to show the legend in a lighter style.
