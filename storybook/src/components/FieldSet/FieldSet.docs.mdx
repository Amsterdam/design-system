## Examples

## With Error

A Field Set can indicate whether any of the inputs it contains has a validation error.

<Canvas of={FieldSetStories.WithError} />

### Radio group

Use a Field Set to group radio buttons.
When grouping radio inputs, use `role="radiogroup"` on Field Set to have this grouping explicitly announced as a radio group.
Field Set has a default role of `group`.

Using `role="radiogroup"` also allows you to use `aria-required` on Field Set, which isn’t allowed for role `group`.
Always set `aria-required` on the individual radio buttons though, to make sure it’s read by screen readers.

### Checkbox group

Use a Field Set to group checkboxes.

Please note: [NVDA has bug](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/12718) which causes it to
not report a description connected to a Field Set when the Field Set contains checkboxes.

Try to avoid using descriptions for Field Sets containing checkboxes for this reason.
