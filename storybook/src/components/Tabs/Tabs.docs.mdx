## Examples

### With initial tab

The first tab is active by default.
Another tabâ€™s panel can be displayed initially as well.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.WithInitialTab} />

### With wide content

The Tab Buttons list and the content within the active Tab Panel will scroll horizontally when their width exceeds the available space.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.WithWideContent} />

### Prevent tabs from changing

The Tab Button `onChange` prop can be used with `event.preventDefault` to stop tabs from changing when clicked.
This is helpful to keep users from switching tabs until specific conditions are met.

You can use this click handler for example:

```jsx
const handleClick = (event) => {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-alert
  const confirmLeave = window.confirm("You have unsaved changes. Do you want to leave?");
  if (!confirmLeave) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
};
```

<Canvas of={TabsStories.PreventTabsFromChanging} />
