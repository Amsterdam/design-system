## Examples

### Above a form field

Keep your hint as brief as possible to avoid a large gap between the label and input.

<Canvas of={FormFieldDescriptionStories.AboveFormField} />

### Below a form field

Use this position when you need to provide more detailed information.
Use only these child components to ensure correct styling:

- `Paragraph` with the `size` prop set to `small`
- `UnorderedList`
- `OrderedList`

<Canvas of={FormFieldDescriptionStories.BelowFormField} />
