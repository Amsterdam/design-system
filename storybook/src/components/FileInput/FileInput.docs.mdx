## Examples

### Multiple Files

Allow multiple files to be selected. The label will update to show the number of files selected.

<Canvas of={FileInputStories.Multiple} />

### Accept

Limit the types of files that can be selected. Some examples are `image/*`, `video/*`, or `audio/*`. To limit to a specific file type, use the MIME type, such as `application/pdf`.

- [MDN File Input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#limiting_accepted_file_types): More examples

<Canvas of={FileInputStories.Accept} />

### Disabled

<Canvas of={FileInputStories.Disabled} />

### In a Field

Use a Field component to group a File Input with a Label and possibly a description.

If you donâ€™t need the description, remove its Paragraph and the `aria-describedby` from the Text Input.

Check [the Field docs](/docs/components-forms-field--docs) for more information on configuring it.
