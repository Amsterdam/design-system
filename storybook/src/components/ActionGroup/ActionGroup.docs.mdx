## Examples

### Stacked

If the Buttons donâ€™t fit next to each other, they will automatically stack vertically and stretch to the full width.
This can occur in a narrow Dialog, with long labels, a large text size, or when zooming in.
Resize the pink rectangle to see this in action.

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Stacked} />

### With Link

An action that involves navigation should be a link.

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.WithLink} />
