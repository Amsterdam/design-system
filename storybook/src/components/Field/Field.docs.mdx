## Examples

### With description

A Field can have a description.
Make sure to connect this description to the input in the Field,
otherwise it won’t be read by a screen reader.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the input and provide the `id` of the describing element as its value.

#### No rich text

Do not use rich text (such as links or lists) in descriptions.
Some screen readers, like VoiceOver, skip over rich text when reading out descriptions.
For more information, see [NL Design System](https://nldesignsystem.nl/richtlijnen/formulieren/descriptions/inhoud/).

### With validation

A Field can indicate if the contained input has a validation error.
Use an [Error Message](/docs/components-forms-error-message--docs) to describe the error.
Make sure to connect the Error Message to the input in the Field,
otherwise it won’t be read by a screen reader.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the input and provide the `id` of Error Message as its value.

Do not use rich text (such as links or lists) in an Error Message. [Find out why](/docs/components-forms-error-message--docs#no-rich-text).

### In a Field Set

Fields can be nested inside a Field Set.
Use the `inFieldSet` prop on the Labels of the Fields to show them in a lighter style.
