## Examples

### With description

A Field can have a description.
Make sure to connect this description to the input in the Field,
otherwise it won’t be read by a screen reader.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the input and provide the `id` of the describing element as its value.

<Canvas of={FieldStories.WithDescription} />

### With validation

A Field can indicate if the contained input has a validation error.
Use an [Error Message](/docs/components-forms-error-message--docs) to describe the error.
Make sure to connect the Error Message to the input in the Field,
otherwise it won’t be read by a screen reader.
Add an `aria-describedby` attribute to the input and provide the `id` of Error Message as its value.
