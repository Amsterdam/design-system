## Examples

### Asking to confirm

Use a `form` when asking the user to confirm an action, e.g. through ‘OK’ and ‘Cancel’ buttons.
Add `method="dialog"` to make the browser close the Dialog when the form is submitted.
Wrap multiple Buttons in an [Action Group](/docs/components-layout-action-group--docs) and place it in the `footer`.
Add an `id` to the form and use it in the `form` attribute of the buttons.
Set a `value` on each button to identify which one was clicked.
Consult [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog#handling_the_return_value_from_the_dialog) for more information.
