## Examples

### Form in a Dialog

Set `method="dialog"` when using a form in Dialog.
This closes the Dialog when submitting the form.
Pass the submit Button to the `footer` prop,
and link it to the form by passing its `id` to the Buttons `form` attribute.
The Dialog returns the value of the submit Button, so you can check which Button was clicked.
For more information, see [Handling the return value from the dialog (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog#handling_the_return_value_from_the_dialog).

<Canvas of={DialogStories.FormDialog} />

### With scrollbar

Content taller than the dialog itself will scroll.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.WithScrollbar} />

### Trigger Button

Click or tap this Button to open the Dialog.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.TriggerButton} />

#### Utility functions

To open the Dialog, use `Dialog.open(id)` from the React package.
Pass the Dialog’s `id` to the function to select it.
To close the Dialog, use `Dialog.close`.

### Vertically stacked Buttons

If the Buttons don’t fit next to each other, they will stack vertically and stretch to the full width.
This can occur with a narrow Dialog, long Button labels, a large text size, or when zooming in.
