## Examples

### Form dialog

The `<form method="dialog">` element is a practical way to manage dialogs.
It simplifies the process by automatically handling the closure and data submission
when a user interacts with a submit or cancel button. For more complex scenarios,
developers can opt for custom handling by adding the form as a child element.
Additionally, creating sticky buttons in a dialog's footer is achievable by placing
a submit button outside the `<form>` and associating it with the form's ID using the
`form` attribute.

### With scrollbar

Content taller than the dialog itself will scroll.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.WithScrollbar} />

### Trigger Button

Click or tap this Button to open the Dialog.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.TriggerButton} />

#### Utility functions

To open the Dialog, use `Dialog.open(id)` from the React package.
Pass the Dialog’s `id` to the function to select it.
To close the Dialog, use `Dialog.close`.

### Vertically stacked Buttons

If the Buttons don’t fit next to each other, they will stack vertically and stretch to the full width.
This can occur with a narrow Dialog, long Button labels, a large text size, or when zooming in.
