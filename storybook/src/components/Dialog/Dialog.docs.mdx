## Examples

### Open and close

To open the Dialog, use `Dialog.open(dialogId)` from the React package.
To close the Dialog, use either `Dialog.close`, or a `<form>` as in the following example.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.OpenAndClose} />

### Asking to confirm

Use a `<form>` when asking to confirm an action, e.g. through ‘OK’ and ‘Cancel’ buttons.
Add `method="dialog"` to let the browser close the Dialog automatically when the form is submitted.

Wrap the buttons in an [Action Group](?path=/docs/components-buttons-action-group--docs) and place it in the `footer`.
This ensures correct whitespace and scrolling behaviour.
At the same time, this will position the buttons outside the `form` element.
Create an `id` for the form and add it to the submit Button’s `form` attribute to connect the two.

If the Action Group needs to live inside of the `form`, add a medium bottom margin (`ams-mb--md`) to the element before it and make scrolling work correctly.

The form returns the `value` of the submit Button, which allows inferring which Button the user clicked.

### Tall content will scroll

Content that doesn’t fit entirely in the Dialog will scroll.
