## Examples

### Form dialog

The preferred way to handle a dialog is by using a `<form method="dialog">` element. The submit button
will automatically close the dialog and return the value of the submit or cancel button. It is optional,
to allow for custom handling of the dialog, so you need to add this form to the children if required.
Then if you want to have sticky buttons in the footer, you can have a submit button outside of the `<form>`
by using the form attribute to target the `id` of the form.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.FormDialog} className="ams-dialog-story" />

### With scrollbar

Content taller than the dialog itself will scroll.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.WithScrollbar} className="ams-dialog-story" />

### Trigger Button

Click or tap this Button to open the Dialog.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.TriggerButton} />

#### Utility functions

To open the Dialog, use `Dialog.open(id)` from the React package.
Pass the Dialog’s `id` to the function to select it.
To close the Dialog, use `Dialog.close`.

### Vertically stacked Buttons

If the Buttons don’t fit next to each other, they will stack vertically and stretch to the full width.
This can occur with a narrow Dialog, long Button labels, a large text size, or when zooming in.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.VerticalButtons} />
