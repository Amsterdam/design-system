## How to use

Use the React Icon component together with a React SVG component from `@amsterdam/design-system-react-icons`.
Import this SVG as follows:

```tsx
import { MailIcon } from "@amsterdam/design-system-react-icons";
```

Then, you can use it in the component like this:

```tsx
<Icon svg={MailIcon} />
```

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Examples

### With body text

An icon is as large as regular body text, e.g. paragraphs and lists, including its line height.

<Canvas of={IconStories.WithBodyText} />

Use the `size` prop to pair an icon with small or large body text.

<Canvas of={IconStories.WithSmallBodyText} />

<Canvas of={IconStories.WithLargeBodyText} />

### With a heading

Use a `size` of `heading-0` â€“ `heading-6` to pair an icon with a [Heading](/docs/components-text-heading--docs).

<Canvas of={IconStories.WithAHeading} />

### Square

An icon is placed inside a container that has the same line height as text.
This helps align the icon with the text.
It also makes the container rectangular.
Sometimes, it's better for the icon to be square, such as with the [Icon Button](/docs/components-buttons-icon-button--docs).

<Canvas of={IconStories.Square} />

### Inverse colour

Use the inverse colour if the Icon sits on a dark background.
This ensures the colour of the icon provides enough contrast.

<Canvas of={IconStories.InverseColour} />
