## How to use

Use the React Icon component together with a React SVG component from `@aram-limpens/design-system-react-icons`.
Import this SVG as follows:

```tsx
import { MailIcon } from "@aram-limpens/design-system-react-icons";
```

Then, you can use it in the component like this:

```tsx
<Icon svg={MailIcon} />
```

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Examples

### Aligning with text

While the icon itself is square, the wrapping Icon component adds a line height for easy alignment with text.
An icon aligns with regular body text by default.
Use the `size` prop to pair an icon with small or large body text or with a heading.

<Canvas of={IconStories.WithBodyText} />

<Canvas of={IconStories.WithAHeading} />

### Square

An icon is placed inside a container that has the same line height as text.
This helps align the icon with the text.
It also makes the container rectangular.
Sometimes, it's better for the icon to be square, such as with the [Icon Button](/docs/components-buttons-icon-button--docs).

<Canvas of={IconStories.Square} />

### Inverse colour

Use the inverse colour if the Icon sits on a dark background.
This ensures the colour of the icon provides enough contrast.

<Canvas of={IconStories.InverseColour} />
