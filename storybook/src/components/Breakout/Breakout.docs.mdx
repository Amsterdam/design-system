This example lets an image pop out.
The text next to it defines the height of the Spotlight.
On narrower screens, the text moves below the image.
Ensure that the text is short, or the image tall, to prevent losing the break-out effect.

_The example isnâ€™t very wide on this page.
And due to how Storybook works, the Grid in the example may incorrectly use 12 columns.
Both circumstances prevent the image from breaking out if the random example text is long.
The [separate page](?path=/story/components-containers-breakout--default) for this example shows this composition better._

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Examples

### Vertical layout

Large content, such as a map, can be placed at the top of the Spotlight, with related text positioned underneath.

<Canvas of={BreakoutStories.MapOnTop} />
