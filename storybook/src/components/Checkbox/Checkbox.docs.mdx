## Examples

### Long label

### In a Field Set

Use a Field Set to group several Checkboxes with a legend, description and / or an Error Message.

Because of an [NVDA bug](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/12718), we add the description text to the Field Set with `aria-labelledby`,
instead of `aria-describedby`.
Screen reader users will no longer be able to skip the description, but we think that is preferable to missing the description entirely.
The order of the `id`s is the order in which they are read by screen readers.

If you don’t need the description, remove its Paragraph and the `aria-labelledby` and `id` attributes from the Field Set.

Do not use rich text (such as links or lists) in descriptions. [Find out why](/docs/components-forms-field--docs#no-rich-text).

Check [the Field Set docs](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) for more information on configuring it.

### In a Field Set with validation

A Field Set with Checkboxes can become invalid.
In this case, connect an Error Message to the Field Set.
Because of [the NVDA bug mentioned earlier](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/12718),
we add the Error Message text to the label as well.
Add an `aria-labelledby` attribute to the Field Set and provide the `id` of Error Message as its value.
The order of the `id`s is the order in which they are read by screen readers.

Do not use rich text (such as links or lists) in an Error Message. [Find out why](/docs/components-forms-error-message--docs#no-rich-text).

Check [the Field Set docs](/docs/components-forms-field-set--docs) for more information on configuring it.

### With custom icon

Replace the icon with a custom version to use the Checkbox in a different theme or visual identity.
Use `ams-checkbox__rectangle`, `ams-checkbox__hover-indicator`, `ams-checkbox__checked-indicator`
and `ams-checkbox__indeterminate-indicator` classes in its SVG markup.
Applications for the City of Amsterdam must use the default icon.
