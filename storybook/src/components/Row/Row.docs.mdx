## Design

The five [space](/docs/foundation-design-tokens-space--docs) sizes are available for the width of the gap.

## How to Use

Wrap a Row around a set of components that need the same amount of white space between them.

## Examples

### Default

<Primary />

<Controls />

### Wrapping

Items that may not fit together on a single line should be allowed to wrap onto multiple lines.

<Canvas of={RowStories.Wrapping} />
