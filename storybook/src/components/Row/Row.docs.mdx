## Design

The five [space](/docs/docs-design-guidelines-space--docs) sizes are available for the width of the gap.

## How to Use

Wrap a Row around a set of components that need the same amount of white space between them.

## Examples

### Default

<Primary />

<Controls />

### Horizontal Alignment

Items in the row can be aligned horizontally in several ways:

- **Center**: center items within the row.
- **End**: align items to the end of the row.
- **Space Between**: distribute whitespace between items.
- **Space Around**: distribute whitespace around items.
- **Space Evenly**: distribute whitespace evenly around items.

By default, items align to the **start** of the row. This options has no class name or prop.

We left out the word ‘space’ from the values for the alignment prop, e.g. `align="around"`.

### Vertical Alignment

Items in the row can be aligned vertically in several ways:

- **Top**: align items to the top of the row.
- **Center**: align items to the middle of the row.
- **Bottom**: align items to the bottom of the row.
- **Baseline**: align items to their common text baseline.

By default, items **stretch** to the height of the row. This options has no class name or prop.

### Wrapping

Items that may not fit together on a single line should be allowed to wrap onto multiple lines.
