## Design

The five [space](/docs/docs-design-guidelines-space--docs) sizes are available for the width of the gap.

## How to Use

Wrap a Row around a set of components that need the same amount of white space between them.

## Examples

### Default

<Primary />

<Controls />

### Horizontal Alignment

Items can be aligned horizontally to the start, center or end of the row.
Or whitespace can be distributed between, around or evenly around them.

<Canvas of={RowStories.HorizontalAlignment} />

### Vertical Alignment

Items can be aligned vertically to the top, middle, or bottom of the row.
They can also align to their common text baseline.
By default, they stretch to fill the height of the row.

<Canvas of={RowStories.VerticalAlignment} />

### Wrapping

Items that may not fit together on a single line should be allowed to wrap onto multiple lines.

<Canvas of={RowStories.Wrapping} />
