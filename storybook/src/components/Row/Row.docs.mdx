## Guidelines

- Wrap a Row around a set of elements that need the same amount of white space between them.
- Five sizes of [Space](/docs/brand-design-tokens-space--docs) are available for the width or height of the gap.
  The medium gap is the default.
- Align the elements horizontally or vertically through the alignment props.

## Examples

### Alignment

Items in the row can be aligned horizontally in several ways:

- **Center**: center items within the row.
- **End**: align items to the end of the row. This is the right side in left-to-right languages.
- **Space Between**: distribute whitespace between items.
- **Space Around**: distribute whitespace around items.
- **Space Evenly**: distribute whitespace evenly around items.

By default, items align to the **start** of the row – the left side in right-to-left languages.
This option has no class name or prop value.

We left out the word ‘space’ from the values for the alignment prop, e.g. `align="around"`.

This example ensures that the spaces between and around all items are equally wide.

#### End-align a single child

To align a single component to the right (in left-to-right languages), wrap it in a `<Row>` and set the `align` prop to `end`.

<Canvas of={RowStories.EndAlignASingleChild} />

For right-to-left languages, the end of the row is on the left side.

#### Align opposing texts

This example shows a right-aligned link next to a heading.

- Use `align="between"` to have all remaining space between them, which pushes the items to the opposing ends of the row.
- Add `alignVertical="baseline"` to align them vertically to their common baseline.
- Include `wrap` to allow the link to wrap to a new line if both components don’t fit on the same line.

### Vertical alignment

Items in the row can be aligned vertically in several ways:

- **Start**: align items to the top of the row.
- **Center**: align items to the middle of the row.
- **End**: align items to the bottom of the row.
- **Baseline**: align items to their common text baseline.

By default, items **stretch** to the height of the row.
This option has no class name or prop value.

This example centers three items vertically.

### Wrapping

Items that may not fit together on a single line should be allowed to wrap onto multiple lines.
