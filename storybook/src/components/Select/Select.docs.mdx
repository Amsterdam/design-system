## Multiple

With `multiple` enabled the attribute `size` is allowed to set the number of rows. Multi select is harder to use
on desktop as they require the user to hold down the `Ctrl` or `Cmd` key while clicking on the options.
You might need to describe this behavior to the user. It is recommended to use checkboxes instead.
On the other hand, it is a good choice for mobile devices.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Multiple} />

## Grouped

Use the `Select.Group` component to group options.
The component requires a `label` attribute.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Grouped} />

## Invalid

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Invalid} />

## Disabled

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Disabled} />
