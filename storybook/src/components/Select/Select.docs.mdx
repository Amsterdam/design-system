## Examples

### Multiple

Avoid adding functionality to allow selecting multiple options. Multi select is harder to use
on desktop as they require the user to hold down the `Ctrl` or `Cmd` key while clicking on the options.
It is recommended to use checkboxes instead.

### Grouped

Use the `Select.Group` component to group options.
The component requires a `label` attribute.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Grouped} />

### Invalid

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Invalid} />

### Disabled

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Disabled} />

### In a Field

Use a Field to group a Select with a Label, description and / or an Error Message.

If you donâ€™t need the description, remove its Paragraph and the `aria-describedby` from the Select.

Check [the Field docs](/docs/components-forms-field--docs) for more information on configuring it.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.InAField} />

### In a Field with validation

If the Select can become invalid, add an Error Message and its `id` to the `aria-describedby` attribute of the Select.

Check [the Field docs](/docs/components-forms-field--docs) for more information on configuring it.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.InAFieldWithValidation} />
