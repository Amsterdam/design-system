Each accordion section has its unique name.
Provide this name via the `label` property of the `Accordion.Section` component.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Examples

### Expanded by default

If you want the contents of an accordion section to appear initially, pass the `expanded` property to the `Accordion.Section` component.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.ExpandedByDefault} />

## Too many landmarks

By default, an accordion section uses the HTML tag `section` to render the content.
Having many accordion sections on your page (more than 6) can lead to too many landmark regions, confusing screen reader users.
In that case, use `section={false}`.
Please note: Storybook does not correctly display this property in the code block.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.TooManyLandmarks} />

## Technical explanation

Currently (28-6-2023), the HTML element `details` element has some accessibility problems.
[For example, a heading in a summary is not adequately understood by screen readers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary#summaries_as_headings) and
NVDA does not read Chrome and Edge’s collapsed and expanded status correctly.
That’s why we chose not to use this native element.
If these problems are solved, we could do this.
