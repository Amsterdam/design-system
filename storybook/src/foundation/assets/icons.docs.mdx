# Icons

An overview of all currently available icons.

While we are migrating to the new iconset new and updated icons are displayed in **bold
text**, deprecated icons as ~~strikethrough~~ and icons that are not in the new set are displayed in _italic text_.
Deprecated icons are currently a copy of the new version but will be removed in the future.
