# Space

## Between components

Five sizes are available for white space between components.
They are fluid and depend on the width of the window.

The medium size is the default.
Multiplication factors for the smaller and larger lengths are ¼, ½, 1½, and 2.

The tables below show the resulting pixels widths at some reference widths.

#### Spacious

In spacious mode, the medium white space grows from 16 to 56 pixels between window widths of 320 and 1600.

|                 |  320   |  576   |  1088  |  1600  |
| --------------: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **Extra small** |   4    |   6    |   10   |   14   |
|       **Small** |   8    |   12   |   20   |   28   |
|      **Medium** | **16** | **24** | **40** | **56** |
|       **Large** |   24   |   36   |   60   |   84   |
| **Extra large** |   32   |   48   |   80   |  102   |

#### Compact

In compact mode, the medium white space grows from 16 to 40 pixels between window widths of 1088 and 2624.

|                 |   1088 |   1600 |   2112 |   2624 |
| --------------: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| **Extra small** |      4 |      6 |      8 |     10 |
|       **Small** |      8 |     12 |     16 |     20 |
|      **Medium** | **16** | **24** | **32** | **40** |
|       **Large** |     24 |     36 |     48 |     60 |
| **Extra large** |     32 |     48 |     64 |     80 |

## About the units we use

We use pixels in our documentation on sizes to convey a more accurate mental image.
In code, sizes are defined in relative units (like `rem`, `em`, `ex`, `vw`, `vh`, and `ch`) to make components more flexible and accessible.
