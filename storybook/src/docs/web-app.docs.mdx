# Progressive Web App: manifest and icons

Turn a website into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with a Web Manifest and app icons.

Here’s how to publish a web app with the proper app names and icons.
This set covers all combinations of common operating systems (Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows) and browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox).

> There is seperate documentation on [how to add a website icon (a “favicon”)](/docs/docs-assets-web-app--docs).

## Usage

### Install the assets

First, install these assets as they come with the [Amsterdam Design System Assets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amsterdam/design-system-assets):

```sh
npm i @amsterdam/design-system-assets
```

### Link the installed assets

You can manually [symlink (symbolic link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link#POSIX_and_Unix-like_operating_systems) and copy the files to the root or a `public` folder next to where the `index.html` is located in your project.
An advantage of symlinking is that it tracks changes to the assets when there are package updates. Symlinks are basically shortcuts to files or directories.

Symlink the app icons and copy the [Web Manifest](https://github.com/Amsterdam/design-system/tree/develop/proprietary/assets/app.manifest):

```sh
# `cd` to the directory where you want to make the symlinks. For example:
cd public

# Symlink the app icons. The symlink file (the last argument) can be named anything you like.
ln -s ../node_modules/@amsterdam/design-system-assets/app-icons app-icons

# Copy the Web Manifest. Don't forget to edit it with the app's name.
cp ../node_modules/@amsterdam/design-system-assets/manifest/app.webmanifest app.webmanifest
```

> Important: the symlink, the last argument in the above command, cannot be a path, but can only be the file or directory name.
> I.e. you need to be in the directory where you want to make the symbolic link.

> Note that undoing a symlink can be done by simply removing the created file or directory link:
>
> ```sh
> rm -r app-icons app.webmanifest
> ```

> Note: not all servers recognize the `.webmanifest` extension.
> See [Using a link element to link to a manifest on W3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#using-a-link-element-to-link-to-a-manifest) for more information.

Make sure that the Web Manifest, stating the app's name and referencing the PNG icons, is available in the same location.
Edit the `app.webmanifest` file to include the app's name and the icons you want to use.
For example:

```json
{
  "name": "A maximum of thirty characters",
  "short_name": "Max 12 chars",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "app-icons/icon-192.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192" },
    { "src": "app-icons/icon-512.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512" }
  ]
}
```

Then link all these assets by placing the following tags in the `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="manifest" href="app.webmanifest" />
  ...
</head>
```

### Submit the changes

The symlink(s) and copied and edited files can be committed to the repository.

## Overview & examples

### Web App Icons

<WebAppIcons />

Include `icons` object in `*.webmanifest` (see [Usage](#usage)):

```json
{
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icon-192.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192" },
    { "src": "/icon-512.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512" }
  ]
}
```

Link the Web Manifest in the `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="app.webmanifest" />
```

> Note: only include a Web Manifest if you want the website to be installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
> Browsers [may prompt the user to install the app](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation-prompt) on their device if a manifest is found.
