# Favicon: the website's icon

Represent the website in bookmarks, on home screens, in syndication and other tools.

Here’s how to display a website icon (a favicon) in the web browser.
This set covers all common browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox).

> There is seperate documentation on [how to publish a web app with the proper app names and icons](/docs/docs-assets-web-app--docs).

## Usage

### Install the assets

First, install these assets as they come with the [Amsterdam Design System Assets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amsterdam/design-system-assets):

```sh
npm i @amsterdam/design-system-assets
```

### Link the installed assets

You can manually [symlink (symbolic link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link#POSIX_and_Unix-like_operating_systems) and copy the files to the root or a `public` folder next to where the `index.html` is located in your project.
An advantage of symlinking is that it tracks changes to the assets when there are package updates. Symlinks are basically shortcuts to files or directories.

Symlinking [the entire favicon directory](https://github.com/Amsterdam/design-system/tree/develop/proprietary/assets/favicon) can be done as follows:

```sh
# `cd` to the directory where you want to make the symlinks. For example:
cd public

# Symlink the icons folder. The symlink file (the last argument) can be named anything you like.
ln -s ../node_modules/@amsterdam/design-system-assets/favicon favicon
```

> Important: the symlink, the last argument in the above command, cannot be a path, but can only be the file or directory name.
> I.e. you need to be in the directory where you want to make the symbolic link.

> Note that undoing a symlink can be done by simply removing the created file or directory link:
>
> ```sh
> rm -r favicon
> ```

Then link all these assets by placing the following tags in the `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon/favicon.ico" size="16x16 32x32 48x48 64x64" />
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon/icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="favicon/apple-touch-icon.png" />
  ...
</head>
```

### Submit the changes

The symlink(s) and edited files can be committed to the repository.

## Overview & examples

### Favicon

<Favicon />

We include a classic icon file with this exact name as a baseline for some browsers and RSS readers.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48 64x64" />
```

### SVG Icon

<SvgIcon />

Roughly 75% of browsers support SVG favicons, which are more efficient and versatile.

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="icon.svg" />
```

### Apple Touch Icon

<AppleTouchIcon />

An iPhone or iPad uses this image when adding the webpage as a shortcut to your home screen.

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="apple-touch-icon.png" />
```
