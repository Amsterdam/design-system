# Modes

The design system offers several modes to meet different needs.

## Density

The design system supports various kinds of applications.
The optimal layout can differ significantly between them.

Our visual style is quite spacious by default.
This works fine for content-oriented websites, but not so much for data-driven applications.
We distinguish two levels of spaciousness to cover both needs.

1. **Spacious Mode** for public websites.
   Large type and generous spacing make reading comfortable.
2. **Compact Mode** for internal applications.
   Smaller text and tighter spacing allow showing more data.

Key characteristics of each mode:

|                           | Spacious Mode | Compact Mode |
| :------------------------ | :-----------: | :----------: |
| **Audience**              |    Public     |   Internal   |
| **Size of body text**     |      20       |      16      |
| **Largest heading size**  |      60       |      28      |
| **Medium spacing length** |      24       |      16      |

## Colour

At the moment, there’s one colour style – a dark mode is on the way.
