# Typeface

We have our own typeface: Amsterdam Sans.

Its clear, open appearance complements the St. Andrews Crosses in the logo.
The typeface is legible both offline and online, so we use it for all communication means.

This sentence shows how all letters and numbers look:

<Typeset
  fontFamily="Amsterdam Sans, Arial, sans-serif"
  fontSizes={[24]}
  fontWeight={400}
  sampleText="Jouw typograaf biedt mij zulke exquise schreven 012345689"
/>

## How to use

If you are working with npm, include our package `@amsterdam/design-system-assets` in your dependencies.
Then import `@amsterdam/design-system-assets/font/index.css` at the beginning of your stylesheet.

You can also host the font yourself and include it in your application.
Request it through the form below.

If it is impossible to use Amsterdam Sans, use the Arial font, or the deviceâ€™s generic sans-serif.
Always specify these alternatives if downloading the font for the user fails, or while it is in progress:

```css
.class {
  font-family: "Amsterdam Sans", Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## Requesting a license

The font is explicitly not freely available.
Amsterdam Sans is licensed exclusively to the City of Amsterdam and amsterdam&partners.
Request the font files through the [Amsterdam Sans request form](https://formulier.amsterdam.nl/thema/huisstijl/amsterdam-sans-aanvragen).
