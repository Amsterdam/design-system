# Icons

An overview of all currently available icons.

## General icons and their names

We name our icons after the objects they picture, like ‘car’, ‘house’, or ‘light bulb’.
This gives some freedom to use them in various contexts and to convey slightly different meanings.

## Universal and functional icons

Some icons are used so often that they have become universal or functional icons.
These icons can be used without labels in certain contexts.
Their names are verbs, as they represent actions rather than objects.
They must not be used in contexts that do not match their names.
