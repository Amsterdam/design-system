# Icons

We have designed our own set of icons.

They can only be used on websites and applications where the City of Amsterdam is the main communicator.

We distinguish functional icons, which have a specific meaning and can be used without labels, from general ones.

## General icons

We name most of our icons after the objects they picture, like ‘car’, ‘house’, or ‘light bulb’.
This allows using them in various contexts or with slightly different meanings.
All these names are nouns.

<IconGallery
  excludeIcons={[
    ...ApplicationIcons,
    ...BrandIcons,
    ...DirectionIcons,
    ...MediaIcons,
    ...SeverityIcons,
    ...UniversalIcons,
    ...FormattingIcons,
    ...KeyboardKeyIcons,
    ...DeprecatedIcons,
  ]}
/>

### Direction

Arrows and chevrons indicate direction or movement.
We use ‘forward’ and ‘backward’ to make them easier to use in languages that read from right to left.

<IconGallery icons={DirectionIcons} />

### Severity

The following icons indicate the tone of an Alert or Error Message.
These components use them without a label.

<IconGallery icons={SeverityIcons} />

### Brands

These icons can accompany links to external products or services:

<IconGallery icons={BrandIcons} />

## Functional icons

Some icons have become so familiar that most users know their meaning.
These can be used without a label, e.g. in an Icon Button.
Their names are verbs that represent their function, and they must not be used for other purposes.

### Universal

The only icons that are widely recognized enough to be used anywhere without a label:

<IconGallery icons={UniversalIcons} />

### Media

The following icons can be used without labels in audio or video players:

<IconGallery icons={MediaIcons} />

### Learnable

In applications that users use so regularly that they can learn the meaning of icons, these can go without labels as well:

<IconGallery icons={ApplicationIcons} />

### Formatting

These icons are used in text editors to indicate formatting options:

<IconGallery icons={FormattingIcons} />

### Keyboard keys

These icons represent common keyboard keys and can be used without labels:

<IconGallery icons={KeyboardKeyIcons} />

### Deprecated

These icons will be removed in the near future.

<IconGallery icons={DeprecatedIcons} />
