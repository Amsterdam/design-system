# Icons

An overview of all currently available icons.

<IconGallery />

## Usage

### General icons

We name our icons after the objects they picture, like ‘car’, ‘house’, or ‘light bulb’.
This gives some freedom to use them in various contexts and to convey slightly different meanings.
All these names are nouns.

### Functional icons

Some icons have become so familiar that most users know their meaning.
These can be used without a label, e.g. in an Icon Button.
Their names are verbs that represent their function, and they must not be used for other purposes.

#### Universal icons

The only icons that are widely recognized enough to be used anywhere without a label:

<IconGallery icons={["CloseIcon", "MaximizeIcon", "SaveIcon", "SaveFillIcon", "SearchIcon"]} />

#### Application icons

In applications that users use so regularly that they can learn the meaning of icons, these can go without labels as well:
