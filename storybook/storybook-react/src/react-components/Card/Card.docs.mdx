## With Tagline

A card can display a tagline above the title, a short term like a category or type of information.
Wrap the tagline and the title in a `Card.HeadingGroup`.
This ensures screen readers first read the title and then the tagline.

## With Image

A card often displays the image of the detail page.
Use [Aspect Ratio](/docs/layout-aspect-ratio--docs) for the correct aspect ratio.
