## Examples

### Placeholder

It is possible to place placeholder text in the text input.
A placeholder should not contain crucial information.
Using a suggestion or example can help clarify something for the user.
Suggestions are not a substitute for an explanation or instruction provided in an error message or description.
Placeholder text disappears as soon as the user starts entering data.

<Canvas of={TextInputStories.Placeholder} />

### Invalid

Whenever possible, use real-time validation of data when filling out forms.
Incorrectly filled input fields become visible immediately.

<Canvas of={TextInputStories.Invalid} />

### Disabled

<Canvas of={TextInputStories.Disabled} />
