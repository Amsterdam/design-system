## Examples

### Default

The list uses ascending numbers as markers, providing enough space for numbers up to 99.
Extra white space between items enhances the distinction, mainly when they consist of multiple lines of text.

<Primary />

<Controls />

### Two Levels

A list may have one nested level.
In this case, lowercase letters are used as markers.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.TwoLevels} />

### Starting Number

When necessary, the list can start with a higher number.
Use the HTML attribute `start`.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.StartingNumber} />

### Reverse Order

The numbers can also be in reverse order.
Use the HTML attribute `reversed`.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.DescendingNumbers} />

### Without Markers

An overview of articles or search results can be presented as an ordered can be seen as an unordered list.
In such cases, apply the list semantics while hiding markers.
This helps screen readers understand and navigate the list.

Note: each item typically contains a container with titles and other text components in this variant.
Therefore, it does not define typography for the items and the `inverseColor` prop has no effect.

For example, here are three news articles:

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.WithoutMarkers} />

### Inverse Colour

Set the `inverseColor` prop if the List sits on a dark background.
This ensures the colour of the text provides enough contrast.
When nesting lists, set the prop on all lists.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.InverseColor} />
