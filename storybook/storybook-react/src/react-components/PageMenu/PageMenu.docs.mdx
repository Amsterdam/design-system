## Examples

### Default

<Primary />

## Right Alignment

It may happen that all menu items do not fit on a single line, for example, in a medium-width window or with zoomed-in text.
If the menu itself is right-aligned, as is often the case in headers, then you should also right-align the items within it.

<Canvas of={PageMenuStories.AlignEnd} />
