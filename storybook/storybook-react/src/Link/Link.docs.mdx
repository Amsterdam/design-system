## Stories

### Standalone

Standalone links are placed directly after content.
They should not be used within sentences or paragraphs.
They never have an icon.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Standalone} />

### Inline

Inline links are used within sentences or paragraphs of text.
An optional icon can be added to inline links, positioned after the link.
Avoid excessive use of inline links on the same page as they can confuse the user.
