## Examples

### Standalone Links

Place standalone links directly after a piece of content.
Don’t use them in sentences or paragraphs.
They should never have an associated icon.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Standalone} />

### Inline Links

Use inline links within sentences or paragraphs of text.
An icon can be added to inline links, positioned after the link.
Don’t use too many inline links on the same page, as it may confuse the user.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Inline} />

### Links in Lists

Use chevrons for lists of links.
Chevrons can be replaced by other icons within a category.
However, a combination of chevrons and icons within a category is not allowed.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.InList} />

<Canvas of={LinkStories.InListWithIcon} />
