## Examples

### Default

An unordered list has square bullet points.
There is extra white space between the items.
This provides better distinction between the items, especially when they consist of multiple lines of text.

<Canvas of={UnorderedListStories.Default} />

### Two levels

A list can have one deeper level.
In this case, an en dash is used as the bullet point.
It is left-aligned with the text of the higher-level item.

<Canvas of={UnorderedListStories.TwoLevels} />

### List without bullet points

An overview of equivalent elements is also an unordered list.
In such cases, use a list without bullet points to convey that semantics.
This helps screen readers understand and navigate the list.

Note: In this variant, each item typically contains a container with titles and other text components.
Therefore, this variant does not define typography for the items.

This example is based on the top tasks on the homepage of the website:

<Canvas of={UnorderedListStories.WithoutMarkers} />

### List with inverted colors for dark backgrounds

When using a dark background, the list can have inverted colors to ensure readability.

<Canvas of={UnorderedListStories.InverseColor} />
