## Usage

- The `<Breadcrumb />` accepts a list of `<Breadcrumb.Item />` components as children.
  Other types are filtered out and, therefore, not shown.
- The `<Breadcrumb.Item />` requires a `href` prop, determining the link.
- The `<Breadcrumb.Item />` goes up to 8 levels deep.
  Deeper items are not shown.
