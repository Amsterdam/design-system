## Examples

### Default

The list uses ascending numbers as bullet points, providing enough space for numbers up to 99.
Extra whitespace between items enhances the distinction, mainly when they consist of multiple lines of text.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.Default} />

### Two Levels

A list may have one nested level.
In this case, lowercase letters are used as bullet points.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.TwoLevels} />

### Higher Starting Number

When necessary, the list can start with a higher number.
Use the HTML attribute `start`.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.StartingNumber} />

### Reverse Order

The numbers can also be in reverse order.
Use the HTML attribute `reversed`.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.DescendingNumbers} />

### List Without Bullet Points

An overview of articles or search results can be presented as an ordered list without bullet points.
In such cases, use a list without bullet points to convey the semantic structure.
This allows screen readers to assist in understanding and navigating the list.

Note: each item typically contains a container with titles and other text components in this variant.
Therefore, it does not define typography for the items.

For example, here are three news articles:

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.WithoutMarkers} />

### List with inverted colors for dark backgrounds

When using a dark background, the list can have inverted colors to ensure readability.

<Canvas of={OrderedListStories.InverseColor} />
