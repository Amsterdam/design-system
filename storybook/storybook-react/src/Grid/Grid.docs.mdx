## Examples

The pink areas below represent the columns of the grid.
The spaces in between are white.

The grid has 12 columns on wide screens, so all 12 cells in this example are in a row.
On narrow screens, you will see three rows of four columns; on medium-wide screens, one row of eight and one of four.

### Vertical Margin

Unlike the horizontal margins between columns, the vertical ones above and below are adjustable.
The `paddingVertical`, `paddingTop`, and `paddingBottom` props add vertical white space above and below the grid.
This is useful in a coloured area like [Footer](?path=/docs/react_containers-footer--docs) or [Spotlight](?path=/docs/react_containers-spotlight--docs) or between two consecutive grids.

Specify a value of `medium` for vertical white space as wide as the horizontal.
Use `small` for half of that width and `large` for double.

These white spaces also shrink and grow with the window width.

### Vertical White Space

A grid automatically creates multiple rows if the next cell no longer fits on the current row.

By default, there is as much white space between two rows as between two columns.
In some cases, more or less white space might be better.

### Cells Spanning Columns

A cell defaults to spanning 1 column in the grid.
Use the `span` prop to make a cell span more columns.

<Canvas of={GridStories.SpanMultipleColumns} />

### Different Widths

You can make the number of columns a cell spans depend on the window width.
Use the `span` prop with 3 values for narrow, medium, and wide windows.

With `span={{ narrow: 4, medium: 6, wide: 8 }}`, this cell is 4 out of 4 columns wide on narrow windows, 6 out of 8 on medium windows, and 8 out of 12 on wide windows.

### Full Width

To make the cell full width – whether the grid has 4, 8, or 12 columns – use `span="all"`.

<Canvas of={GridStories.SpanAllColumns} />

### Start Position

Each cell automatically starts in the next available position in the grid.
You usually don’t need to specify a value of 1 explicitly.
You can adjust the starting position of a cell with the `start` prop.
This way, you can align cells in multiple rows or place a cell in the centre of a wide grid.
It can also skip a column for more white space between cells.

The starting position of a cell may also depend on the window width.
Use the `start` prop with 3 values, just like with `span`.

An example with `start={2}`:

<Canvas of={GridStories.StartPosition} />

### Use Another HTML Element

By default, a Grid Cell renders a `<div>`.
Use the `as` prop to make your markup more semantic.

<Canvas of={GridStories.CustomTagName} />

## Guidelines

Ensure that the number of columns you assign to a cell matches the amount of columns in the grid for the respective window width.
The same applies to starting a cell in a later column.
If the total of both values is too large, the browser adds columns to the grid.
This is not allowed.
