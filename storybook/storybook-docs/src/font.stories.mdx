# Font

We use the Amsterdam Sans font.

This is a typeface with a clear, open appearance that complements the Andreaskruisen well.
The font is legible both offline and online, so we use it for all communication means.

In this sentence, you can see how all letters and numbers look:

<Typeset
  fontFamily="Amsterdam Sans, Arial, sans-serif"
  fontSizes={[24]}
  fontWeight={400}
  sampleText="Jouw typograaf biedt mij zulke exquise schreven 012345689"
/>

## Installation

If you are working with npm, include our package `@amsterdam/design-system-assets` in your dependencies.
Then import `@amsterdam/design-system-assets/font/index.css` at the beginning of your stylesheet.

You can also host the font yourself and include it in your application.
Request it through the form below.

If itâ€™s not possible to use Amsterdam Sans, apply the Arial font, or the generic sans-serif font of the device.
In all cases, specify these alternatives in case downloading the font for the user fails, or while it is in progress:

```css
.class {
  font-family: "Amsterdam Sans", Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## Requests

The font is explicitly not freely available.
Amsterdam Sans is exclusively for use by employees of the Municipality of Amsterdam, amsterdam&partners, and suppliers working for these organizations.

Request the font files through the [Amsterdam Sans request form](https://formulier.amsterdam.nl/thema/huisstijl/amsterdam-sans-aanvragen).
