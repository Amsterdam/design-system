# Breakpoints

We use 2 breakpoints where the design of a website adjusts for a good user experience: at screen widths of 576px and 1088px.

We follow a mobile-first approach: first, we create the design below the breakpoint, and then we use a media query to create the design above the breakpoint.

For example:

```css
.class {
  /* Your narrow styling */

  @media screen and (min-width: $amsterdam-breakpoint-wide) {
    /* Your wide styling */
  }
}

Within this repository, you can import the breakpoint as a Sass variable.
You can find this variable in [packages/css/src/common/breakpoint.scss](https://github.com/Amsterdam/design-system/blob/main/packages/css/src/common/breakpoint.scss).
```
