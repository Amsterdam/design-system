# Footer

The footer is the closing section on every web page.
Its content provides service information.
A part is prescribed, and a part is filled based on the websiteâ€™s objectives.

## Guidelines

- The footer is mandatory, and there is one on every page.
- The first column focuses on contact information.
  The information is as specific as possible and tailored to the respective website or page (e.g., including a chat option if available).
- The second column contains links to relevant (online) sites or sources.
- The third column refers to newsletters, social media, etc.
- The last part of the footer is intended for links to privacy policies, cookie statements, explanations about the website, etc.
  It is not intended for links to contact information, for example.
`;function n(o){return e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx(r,{of:c}),`
`,e.jsx(s,{children:m}),`
`,e.jsx(a,{})]})}function y(o={}){const{wrapper:t}={...i(),...o.components};return t?e.jsx(t,{...o,children:e.jsx(n,{...o})}):n()}export{y as default};
