# Top Task Link

A prominent navigation element to quickly start a task.

## Guidelines

- A Top Task Link has both a title and a description.
- The title describes the essence of the page being referred to, attracting attention when scanning the page.
- The description provides more context, helping the user confirm that they can indeed achieve their goal on the linked page.
- Keep both texts concise.
  A title consists of a few words, and the description consists of 1 or 2 short sentences.
  The description should end with a period or another appropriate punctuation mark.
- For wide windows, place 3 or 4 Top Task Links side by side on the [Grid](/docs/components-layout-grid--docs).
  If you have more Top Task Links, place them in the next row.
  Try to distribute the amount of links on wide windows over rows of 3 or 4 links.
  If this is not possible, leave the last cells of the grid empty.
- If you have a group of links for which a description is unnecessary or illogical, use a [Link List](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs).

## Relevant WCAG requirements

The Top Task Link is subject to the same requirements as [regular links](/docs/components-navigation-link--docs).
`;function o(n){const t=Object.assign({h3:"h3",p:"p"},s(),n.components);return e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx(i,{of:d}),`
`,e.jsx(r,{children:l}),`
`,e.jsx(a,{}),`
`,e.jsx(c,{}),`
`,e.jsx(t.h3,{id:"meerdere-links",children:"Meerdere links"}),`
`,e.jsx(t.p,{children:`Top tasks usually come in groups.
Present them in a grid.`}),`
`,e.jsx(p,{of:h})]})}function L(n={}){const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},s(),n.components);return t?e.jsx(t,Object.assign({},n,{children:e.jsx(o,n)})):o(n)}export{L as default};
